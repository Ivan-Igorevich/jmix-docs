= Views

A _view_ is a basic building block of the application UI. It is a root of the hierarchy of visual components and can also contain data components, actions and facets.

A view is defined by a Java class. The class usually has a corresponding XML file called _descriptor_, which defines the view content. So there is a clear separation between declarative layout of components defined in XML and programmatic initialization and event handling logic written in Java.

[[view-classes]]
== View Classes

Jmix provides the following base classes for views:

image::views/views-diagram.svg[align="center"]

[[view]]
=== View

`View` defines the state and behavior of all varieties of existing views.

[[standard-main-view]]
=== StandardMainView

`StandardMainView` is a root application view which is opened after login. It contains the {vaadin-docs}/components/app-layout[AppLayout^] component with the main menu.

image::views/main-view-1.png[align="center"]

[[standard-view]]
=== StandardView

`StandardView` is a base class for regular views. Such views can be shown either inside the main view using navigation to the view URL or in a popup dialog window.

Below is a standard view opened using the `/my-onboarding` URL:

image::views/standard-view-1.png[align="center"]

[[standard-list-view]]
=== StandardListView

`StandardListView` is a base class for CRUD views displaying a list of entities. It can also be used as a lookup view to select entity instances from the list and return them to the caller. A list view usually uses the xref:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] or xref:vc/components/treeDataGrid.adoc[] components.

Below is a list view opened using the `/departments` URL:

image::views/list-view-1.png[align="center"]

The same view opened in a dialog for selecting entities:

image::views/list-view-2.png[align="center"]

[[standard-detail-view]]
=== StandardDetailView

`StandardDetailView` is a base class for CRUD views displaying a single entity instance. A detail view usually uses the xref:vc/layouts/formLayout.adoc[] component.

Below is a detail view opened using entity id in the URL:

image::views/detail-view-1.png[align="center"]

The same view opened in a dialog:

image::views/detail-view-2.png[align="center"]

[[view-annotations]]
== View Annotations

Annotations on view classes provide information about the views to the framework. Some annotations are applicable to any type of view, some of them can be used only on entity list or detail views.

[[common-annotations]]
=== Common Annotations

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/myonboarding/MyOnboardingView.java[tags=annotations]
----

* `@ViewController` annotation indicates that the class is a view. The value of the annotation is the view id which can be used to refer to the view from the xref:menu-config.adoc[main menu] or when opening the view programmatically.

* `@ViewDescriptor` annotation connects the view class to the XML descriptor. The value of the annotation specifies the path to the descriptor file. If the value contains a file name only, it is assumed that the file is located in the same package as the view class.

* `@com.vaadin.flow.router.Route` defines a URL path for navigation to this view. As long as the view should be opened inside the main view, the `layout` attribute specifies the main view class.

* `@DialogMode` annotation defines parameters of the dialog window when the view is opened as a dialog.

* `@com.vaadin.flow.server.auth.AnonymousAllowed` makes the view available without authentication. By default, only the login view is available to the anonymous (not authenticated) session.

TIP: See the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-samples-2/tree/main/user-registration[User Registration^] sample project for how the `@AnonymousAllowed` annotation is used in a view for self-registration of users.

[[list-view-annotations]]
=== List View Annotations

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/department/DepartmentListView.java[tags=annotations]
----

* `@LookupComponent` annotation specifies an id of a UI component to be used for getting a value returned from the lookup.

* `@PrimaryLookupView` annotation indicates that this view is the default lookup view for the specified entity. The annotation has greater priority than the `\{entity_name}.lookup` / `\{entity_name}.list` xref:opening-views.adoc#view-inference-conventions[name convention].

[[detail-view-annotations]]
=== Detail View Annotations

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/department/DepartmentDetailView.java[tags=annotations]
----

* `@EditedEntityContainer` annotation specifies a data container that contains the edited entity.

* `@PrimaryDetailView` annotation indicates that this view is the default detail view for the specified entity. The annotation has greater priority than the `\{entity_name}.detail` xref:opening-views.adoc#view-inference-conventions[name convention].

//[[events]]
//== View Events
//
//This section describes the screen lifecycle events that can be handled in controllers.
//
//[[init-event]]
//=== InitEvent
//
//`InitEvent` is sent when the screen controller and all its declaratively defined components are created, and dependency injection is completed. Nested fragments are not initialized yet. Some visual components are not fully initialized, for example, buttons are not linked with actions.
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderBrowse1.java[tags=init-event]
//----
//
//[[init-entity-event]]
//== InitEntityEvent
//
//`InitEntityEvent` is sent in screens inherited from `StandardEditor` and `MasterDetailScreen` before the new entity instance is set to edited entity container.
//
//Use this event listener to initialize default values in the new entity instance, for example:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderEdit1.java[tags=init-entity]
//----
//
//[[before-show-event]]
//== BeforeShowEvent
//
//`BeforeShowEvent` is sent right before the screen is shown, for example, it is not added to the application UI yet. Security restrictions are applied to UI components. In this event listener, you can load data, check permissions and modify UI components. For example:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderBrowse1.java[tags=before-show1;before-show2]
//----
//
//[[after-show-event]]
//== AfterShowEvent
//
//`AfterShowEvent` is sent right after the screen is shown, for example, when it is added to the application UI. In this event listener, you can show notifications, dialogs or other screens. For example:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderBrowse1.java[tags=after-show1;after-show2]
//----
//
//[[before-close-event]]
//== BeforeCloseEvent
//
//`BeforeCloseEvent` is sent right before the screen is closed by its `close(CloseAction)` method. The screen is still displayed and fully functional. In this event listener, you can check any conditions and prevent screen closing using the `preventWindowClose()` method of the event, for example:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderEdit1.java[tags=before-close1;before-close2]
//----
//
//The `Window` interface has also an event with the same name. It is sent before the screen is closed by an external (relative to the controller) action, like clicking on the button in the window tab or by pressing the *Escape* key. The way the window is closed can be obtained using the `getCloseOrigin()` method which returns a value implementing the `CloseOrigin` interface. Its default implementation `CloseOriginType` has three values:
//
//* `BREADCRUMBS` - the screen is closed by clicking on the breadcrumbs link.
//* `CLOSE_BUTTON` - the screen is closed by the close button in the window header or by the window tab close button or context menu actions: Close, Close All, Close Others.
//* `SHORTCUT` - the screen is closed by the keyboard shortcut defined in the xref:ui:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.screen.close-shortcut[jmix.ui.screen.close-shortcut] application property.
//
//You can subscribe to `Window.BeforeCloseEvent` by specifying `Target.FRAME` in the `@Subscribe` annotation:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderEdit3.java[tags=before-close]
//----
//
//[[after-close-event]]
//== AfterCloseEvent
//
//`AfterCloseEvent` is sent after the screen is closed by its `close(CloseAction)` method and after `Screen.AfterDetachEvent`. In this event listener, you can show notifications or dialogs after closing the screen, for example:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/OrderEdit3.java[tags=after-close1;after-close2]
//----
