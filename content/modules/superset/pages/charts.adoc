= Charts

In this section, you will:

* Create a Bar Chart
* Create a Table Chart
* Create a Big Number Chart

In Apache Superset, a chart refers to a visual representation of data from a dataset. It has a lot of types: Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Treemap, Table, etc.

Charts can be combined into dashboards, which provide a comprehensive view of data across multiple charts.

We will create three charts for visualizing employees' salaries data:

- Bar Chart
- Big Number Chart
- Table Chart

[[bar-chart]]
== Bar Chart

The Bar Chart will show the salary of each employee. To create new chart navigate to *Charts* in top menu and create new chart by clicking on *+ CHART* button.

In the opened screen:

* select `Employees' salaries` dataset
* select `Bar Chart`
* click on *CREATE NEW CHART* button.

In the chart configuration:

* drop the `full_name` column to *X-AXIS* field
* drop `salary` column to *METRICS* field with `SUM` aggregation:

Set the name for this chart - "*Salary by employee*" and save without adding to a dashboard.

[[table-chart]]
== Table Chart

In a table chart we will show an average salary by department. Navigate to *Charts* in top menu and create new chart by clicking on *+ CHART* button.

* Select `Employees' salaries` dataset.
* Select `Table` chart.
* Click on *CREATE NEW CHART* button.

In the opened screen:

* drop to "*DIMENSIONS*" the "*department_name*" column.

Then we will create aggregation by salary column.

* Click on "*METRICS*" field
* Select "*SIMPLE*" tab and for salary column choose "*AVG*" aggregation:

Set the name for this chart - "*Salary by department*" and save without adding to a dashboard.

[[big-number-chart]]
== Big Number Chart
The "*Big Number*" chart is used to display a single, prominent metric or value. It is often used to highlight important numbers in a dashboard. Here we will show the average salary by all users.

Create new chart and select "*Jmix users salary*" dataset, select "*Big Number*" chart and click on "*CREATE NEW CHART*" button.

Drop the "salary" column to "*METRICS*" field and select "*AVG*" aggregation:

Save it. In "*SUBHEADER*" field enter - "*AVG users salary*". Click on "*CREATE CHART*" and you will see the following result:
