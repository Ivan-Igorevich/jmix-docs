= Migration from Classic UI

Due to the major incompatibility between Classic and Flow UI, the automatic upgrade from Jmix 1.5 Classic UI to Jmix {page-component-display-version} is impossible. This section provides instructions for how to upgrade an application based on Jmix 1.5 Classic UI manually.

== Converting Project to Flow UI

First, you need to remove Classic UI from the project and adapt the project structure and build scripts to Flow UI.

. Open the Classic UI project in the IDE.
+
Later in this guide we will refer to this project as the "migrating" one.

. Create a new project on the latest Jmix 1.5 version in a different folder using the `Full-Stack Application with Incubating FlowUI` template. Choose the same name and base package as in the migrating project.
+
Later in this guide we will refer to this project as the "created" one.

. Copy the following files from the root of the created project to the migrating one:
+
[source,text]
----
.gitignore
build.gradle
package.json
tsconfig.json
types.d.ts
vite.config.ts
----
+
Here and below do the copying by executing *Copy* in the *Project* tool window of the source project, then executing *Paste* on the appropriate node of the destination project.

. In the migrating project, remove the following directories (turn off *Safe delete* to avoid useless IDE warnings):
.. `src/main/java/<base_package>/screen`
.. `src/main/resources/<base_package>/screen`
.. `src/main/themes`
.. `src/main/resources/<base_package>/theme`

. Copy the following directories from the created project to the migrating one:

.. `frontend`
.. `src/main/java/<base_package>/view`
.. `src/main/resources/<base_package>/view`
.. `src/main/resources/META-INF`

. In `application.properties` of the migrating project:
.. Remove `++jmix.ui.*++` properties.
.. Copy `++jmix.flowui.*++`, `++ui.*++`, `++vaadin.*++` properties from the created project to the migrating one.

. Copy the `src/main/resources/<base_package>/menu.xml` file from the created project to the migrating one and overwrite the existing file.

. Open `src/main/resources/<base_package>/messages_en.properties` file of the migrating project and remove `++<base_package>.screen.*++` and `++<base_package>/menu.application++` messages from it. Copy `++<base_package>.view.*++` and `++<base_package>/menu.application.title++` messages from the same file of the created project.

. Copy `FullAccessRole` and `UiMinimalRole` classes of the `<base_package>.security` package from the created project to the migrating one.

. In other existing roles of the migrating project, remove the `io.jmix.securityui.role.annotation.MenuPolicy` and `io.jmix.securityui.role.annotation.ScreenPolicy` annotations.

. Add the following code to the main application class:
+
[source,java]
----
@Push
@Theme(value = "<project_name>")
@PWA(name = "<project_name>", shortName = "<project_name>")
class ... implements AppShellConfigurator
----
+
For example:
+
[source,java]
----
// ...
import com.vaadin.flow.component.page.AppShellConfigurator;
import com.vaadin.flow.component.page.Push;
import com.vaadin.flow.server.PWA;
import com.vaadin.flow.theme.Theme;
// ...

@Push
@Theme(value = "onboarding")
@PWA(name = "Onboarding", shortName = "Onboarding")
@SpringBootApplication
public class OnboardingApplication implements AppShellConfigurator {
----

. Run the *Reload All Gradle Projects* action in the *Gradle* tool window to re-import the project in the IDE.

. Upgrade the project to the latest Jmix {page-component-display-version} using the standard Studio xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[upgrade procedure].

. Add required add-ons using the Marketplace or by adding starters manually as described in the add-on documentation.

. Execute *Build* -> *Build Project* and resolve compilation errors if any.

. Run the application.

.. Studio will show the *Liquibase Root Changelog Check* window and suggest to remove the `include` statements that refer to modules not available for Jmix {page-component-display-version} Flow UI project (for example, `/io/jmix/uidata/liquibase/changelog.xml`). Accept the changes and proceed.

.. Studio will create a few changesets for dropping `UI_FILTER_CONFIGURATION`, `UI_SETTING` and `UI_TABLE_PRESENTATION` tables. You should save and apply these changesets because these tables do not contain any useful data for Flow UI.

.. If your database contains tables of add-ons not present in Jmix {page-component-display-version}, make sure you don't drop these tables. Either click *Remove from Changelog* -> *Remove and Ignore* for the corresponding `dropTable` changesets in the Liquibase changelog generation window, or cancel the process and add the `main.datasource.studio.liquibase.exclude-prefixes` application property before running the application again. For example:
+
[source,properties]
----
main.datasource.studio.liquibase.exclude-prefixes = FOO_
----

After the application is started, you should be able to log in and open the standard user management views.

[[developing-views]]
== Developing New Views

At this point, you have a working application based on Jmix {page-component-display-version}. The user interface includes only views provided by the new application template: `LoginView`, `MainView`, `UserListView` and `UserDetailView`.

The next step is to create CRUD views for your data model entities using the xref:studio:view-wizard.adoc[].

As a result, you will have the application with the old data model and backend logic and a new user interface that allows you to manage data through the standard list/detail views. After that, you will need to customize the user interface using the xref:flow-ui:index.adoc[Flow UI] API and set of components.
