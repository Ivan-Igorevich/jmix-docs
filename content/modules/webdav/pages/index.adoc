= WebDAV

include::ROOT:partial$outdated-ui-warning.adoc[]

The main purpose of the WebDAV add-on is to give access to files located in the xref:files:file-storage.adoc[file storage] through the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV[WebDAV protocol^]. This allows users to seamlessly open and edit files using their desktop applications (Word, Excel, LibreOffice, etc.) without the need to download and upload files to the web application.

The add-on provides the following additional features:

* Document version control. If the versioning is enabled for a document, a new version of the document is created on the server each time the document is updated.

* Configurable conflict resolution policies that help in collaborative work on documents.

* Granting and restricting access to certain documents.

* UI components to work with files and versions.

* Access to files from external systems using static links.

[[https]]
== HTTPS

Desktop applications use basic authentication when connecting to the server through WebDAV, so you have to setup HTTPS for your web application. See xref:configuration.adoc#https[Configuring HTTPS] for an example of setting up HTTPS on localhost for development purposes.

[[requirements]]
== Minimal Requirements

The minimum version of Microsoft Office required for opening documents via the WebDAV protocol is MS Office 2010 SP2 or higher. The minimum version of LibreOffice is 6.3.
