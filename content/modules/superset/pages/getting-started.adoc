= Getting Started with Superset
:page-aliases: superset:quick-start.adoc

This section provides instructions on getting started with integrating Superset into your application.

You will use the Onboarding application as a starting point.
If you haven't created this application, you can refer to the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section, which offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for developing the application.

Otherwise, download the complete application source code from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository. Next, follow the instructions in the xref:studio:project.adoc#opening-existing-project[Opening Existing Project] section to open it in Jmix Studio.

Add the Superset add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

Letâ€™s look at the model of the sample onboarding application.

You need to add the following attribute to the `User`:

* Salary (float)

To see filled salary in demonstration data, you should set a salary value in `DemoDataInitializer` class. You can see an example in complete tutorial branch: https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2/tree/superset-tutorial[superset-tutorial].

The Salary and Department attributes will serve as the basis for the following charts in a Superset dashboard:

* A bar chart to compare employees' salaries.
* A table with the average salary by department.
* A card to show the employees' average salary.

These charts will enable more data-driven decisions in HR management and planning.
