= Charts

In this section, you will:

* Create a Bar Chart
* Create a Table
* Create a Big Number

In Apache Superset, a chart refers to a visual representation of data from a dataset. It has a lot of types: Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Treemap, Table, etc.

Charts can be combined into dashboards, which provide a comprehensive view of data across multiple charts.

We will create three charts for visualizing employees' salaries data:

- Bar Chart
- Big Number
- Table

[[bar-chart]]
== Bar Chart

The *Bar Chart* will show the salary of each employee. To create new chart navigate to *Charts* in top menu and create new chart by clicking on *+ CHART* button.

In the opened screen:

* select `Employees' salaries` dataset
* select `Bar Chart`
* click on *CREATE NEW CHART* button.

In the chart configuration:

* drop the `full_name` column to *X-AXIS* field
* drop `salary` column to *METRICS* field with `SUM` aggregation:
