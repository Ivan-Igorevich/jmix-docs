= Getting Started with WebDAV

This tutorial provides instructions on getting started with integrating the WebDAV add-on into your application.

== Project Setup

We are developing an Onboarding Application - a tool designed to assist newcomers as they navigate through all the necessary steps when starting a new role or position.

We will use the Onboarding application as a starting point.

. If you haven't created this application, you can refer to the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section, which offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for developing the base application.

. Otherwise, download the complete application source code from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository. Next, follow the instructions in the xref:studio:project.adoc#opening-existing-project[Opening Existing Project] section to open it in Jmix Studio.

. Add the WebDAV add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

== What We Are Going to Do

In this tutorial, we'll introduce a new feature to the Onboarding application.

Onboarding involves training new employees, with an essential component being acquainting them with the company's *knowledge base*.

Typically, the knowledge base includes company-wide standards and rules, operational procedures, as well as procedures, instructions, and best practices for each department and position. To ensure the knowledge base remains current, monitor updates, and support collaborative document work, an Internal Knowledge Management System is indispensable.

* Grant employees access to current information and monitor data modifications.
* Establish access controls and safeguard sensitive information.
* Foster collaboration on documents and prevent data mishaps during concurrent document editing.
* Maintain an audit trail of revisions and offer access to prior document versions.

== Data Model

Letâ€™s look at the model of the sample onboarding application.
