= Creating Notifications

You can create notifications via administration UI or programmatically in code.

[[administration-ui]]
== Administration UI

After the add-on is added to your application, the main menu contains the *Notifications* item. The *Notifications browser* provides a list of created notifications and buttons for managing them.

The dialog provides the following fields to fill in:

* *Subject* – a subject of the notification.
* *Type* – a type of notification. There are no default notification types. See the xref:notifications:configuration.adoc#notification-types[configuration] section to create types.
* *Recipients* – list of recipients of the notification. Start typing a username in the field, and select the appropriate users from the list.
* *Channels* – a channel used for notification.
** *In-app channel* – a user will receive the notification in the application UI.
** *Email channel* – a user will receive an email with the notification. (available with xref:email:index.adoc[Email] add-on.)
* *Body* – body of the notification.

[[programmatic-creation]]
== Programmatic Creation

The *NotificationManager* service provides methods to send notifications to users.

In the example below, a notification is sent to the user every time a new order is created.
