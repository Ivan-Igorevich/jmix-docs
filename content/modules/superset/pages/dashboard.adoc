In this section, you will create a Superset dashboard and embed it into the Jmix application.

== Create Dashboard

Dashboard is a single, unified space where you can gather and display multiple charts. Dashboards can be customized by resizing charts, rearranging their layout, and adding new charts.

You will create a dashboard that will combine three charts created in the previous section and prepare it to be embedded in a Jmix application.

To create a new dashboard navigate to *Dashboards* in the top menu and click on *+ DASHBOARD* button.

You will see the created charts in the opened screen.

* Add created charts to the dashboard in the following order:

* Enter the name of the dashboard - `Employees' salaries` and save.

After saving the dashboard, you should configure its settings to make it available for embedding.

* Click on the settings button in the top right corner and select the *Embed dashboard* menu item.

It will show the dialog with configuration.

* Click on the *ENABLE EMBEDDING* button. The Superset generates an _embedded ID_ of this dashboard that you can use in a Jmix application.

[[embed]]
== Embed Dashboard into Jmix Application

To show created dashboard in Jmix, use the xref:dashboard-component.adoc[SupersetDashboard] component. It requires an embedded ID that you have previously generated in the dashboard settings.

* Create a new view named *Salaries dashboard* using the `Blank view` template in Studio.

* Add the `SupersetDashboard` component to layout using the *Add Component* action.

* Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes of the added `superset:dashboard` element as follows:
    - `id` =  `dashboard`
    - `height` = `100%`
    - `width` = `100%`

* Copy the embedded ID from Superset dashboard and set to the `embeddedId` attribute.

XML of the configured component should look as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$superset-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/salariesdashboard/salaries-dashboard-view.xml[tags=dashboard]
----

* Once you have completed these steps, restart or hot deploy the changes you have made in the view descriptor and refresh the page.

As a result of following this tutorial, you will have the embedded Superset dashboard in your Jmix application:
