= Radar Chart

In this section, you will:

* Create a radar chart
* Add `indicator`, and `title` elements
* Bind data through a data container

[[radar-setup]]
== Radar Chart Setup

You will integrate a `radar` chart component to illustrate the employees' skill metrics, namely: `hardSkills`, `problemSolving`, `softSkills` and `teamwork`.

[[radar-series-setup]]
=== Setting Radar Chart Series

First, you will insert the chart component in `user-list-view.xml`.

First, click on the `formLayout` where the chart will be located.

Choose *Add Component* in the actions panel and select the *Chart* item to insert the `<charts:chart/>` element. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=radarChartElement]
----

Next, add a radar series to your chart. Click on the `chart` element in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the view XML descriptor, then click the *Add* button in the inspector panel. Choose *Series -> Radar* from the drop-down list.

[[radar-properties]]
== Adding Chart Properties

[[radar-indicators]]
=== Indicators

A radar chart with multiple axes requires indicators within a separate `radar` element under `chart`. The indicators represent each metric's axis.

To add indicators, create a `<charts:radar/>` element manually. Select the `radar` element and choose *Add -> Indicators -> Indicator*.

Define each skill as an indicator with `name` and `max` value attributes to represent the scale as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]

include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=indicators]
----

[[radar-title]]
=== Title

Add a title to your chart to provide context. Select the chart component and choose *Add -> Title*, then configure the text attribute.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=radarTitle]
----

[[radar-data-binding]]
== Binding Data using Data Container

For your radar chart, you can use the `emloyeesDc` data container you've set in the xref:charts:bar-chart.adoc#_binding_data_using_data_container[bar chart] section.

To include the fetched data to the chart, select the `chart` component and add a `dataSet` attribute manually.

[source, xml]
----
<charts:dataSet/>
----

Inside the `dataSet` tag, choose the `employeesDc` container for your `source` attribute. The radar chart only needs a `valueFields` as its axes.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=radarTitle]
----

Once you complete these steps, your bar chart XML configuration will be as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=radarChart]
----

This radar chart is set up to visually represent employees' skills.
