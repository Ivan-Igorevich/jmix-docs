= Getting Started with BPM
:page-aliases: bpm:quick-start.adoc

This section describes how to model and run a simple business process. For that, we will create a process for requesting and approving reimbursement.

The process involves three participants:

* an employee who requests a reimbursement;
* a manager who approves the reimbursement;
* an accountant who processes payment upon approval.

In terms of BPM, we will be building the following model:

image::quick-start/model.png[align="center"]

[[modeling-process]]
== Modeling Process

Start the application and open the *BPM -> Modeler* view. The right panel contains a list of properties for the current process.

For our reimbursement process enter the following values:

* *Process id*: `reimbursement`
* *Name*: `Reimbursement`
* *Documentation*: Add a short description for the process.
+
image::quick-start/properties.png[align="center" width="1392"]

[[creating-start-form]]
=== Creating Start Form

Each element on the canvas has its own properties. At the moment the only element present is `StartEvent`. It represents the <<start-form, Start form>> seen by the user who is initiating the process. Let's configure it:

* Click on the `StartEvent` element to select it.
+
* Select `Input dialog` in the *Form Type* field. Its *Open mode* is automatically set to *Dialog*.
+
image::quick-start/start-event.png[align="center" width="1392"]

Next, create input parameters to prompt the user enter values to this form:

* Click image:quick-start/plus-button.png[[align="center", width="32"] and add `requestNumber` parameter with the following properties:

// ** *Process variable*: `requestNumber`
// ** *Caption* – Request number (this will be generated automatically.)
// ** *Type* – String
// ** *Editable* – true
// ** *Required* – true

image::quick-start/request-number.png[align="center" width="602"]

* Repeat the previous step to create three more input parameters:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|true
|true

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|true
|true

|`document`
|Document
|File
|true
|true

|===

* Next, create an input parameter to let users select a manager for approval. This will require a few additional properties:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required | Entity name | UI Component | JPQL query

|`manager`
|Manager
|Entity
|true
|true
|User
|ComboBox
|_leave blank^*^_
|===
+
__^*^ If no query is specified, this field defaults to__ `select e from User e`.
+
*  Set `requestNumber` as the *Business key* field value. A business key is a domain-specific identifier of a process instance.

After adding all the parameters, the *Form* section should look as follows:

image::quick-start/form.png[align="center" width="340"]

// When a process is started, input dialog values will be saved to the corresponding process variables.

[[creating-approval-task]]
=== Creating Approval Task

Create a task for approval. It will be represented by the <<approval-form,Approval form>> seen by the manager assigned to approve the reimbursement.

First, add a new element on the canvas:

* Click on the `StartEvent` element to select it.
* Click the *Append task* image:quick-start/append-task-icon.png[width="20"] icon.
* Click the *Change type* image:quick-start/change-type-icon.png[width="20"] icon and select *User Task* in the drop-down.
+
image::quick-start/user-task.gif[align="center" width="660"]
+
* For this User task specify the following *General* properties:
** *Id*: `approval`
** *Name*: `Approval`
** *Assignee source*: `Process variable`
** *Process variable*: `manager`
+
image::quick-start/manager.png[align="center" width="280"]
+
TIP: By default, the built-in `initiator` process variable is available to assign a task. See the xref:bpm:user-task.adoc#process-variable[corresponding section] for more details.
+
* Proceed to the *Form* section and specify the following properties:
** *Form type*: `Input dialog`
** *Open mode*: `Dialog` (this will be set by default)

* Click image:quick-start/plus-button.png[[align="center", width="36"] and add the following existing parameters making them non-editable:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`requestNumber`
|Request number
|String
|false
|true

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|false
|true

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|false
|true

|`document`
|Document
|File
|false
|true
|===
+
* Click image:quick-start/plus-button.png[[align="center", width="36"] and create one additional parameter for this form:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`comment`
|Comment
|Multiline string
|true
|false
|===
+
This parameter will be represented by a text field allowing manager to leave notes during the approval step.

[[creating-outcomes]]
=== Creating Outcomes

The *Approval* step has two outcomes: approved or rejected. Therefore, the manager making decision should see two buttons on the form.

* Make sure the Approval element is selected. Then go to *Outcomes* properties and click image:quick-start/plus-button.png[[align="center", width="36"].
* Set properties for the first outcome:
// +
// [cols="1,1,1"]
// |===
// |Business id | Caption | Icon
//
// |`approve`
// |Approve
// |CHECK
// |===
+
image::quick-start/outcome-approve.png[align="center" width="613"]
+
* Repeat to create the second outcome:
+
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Business id | Caption | Icon

|`reject`
|Reject
|BAN
|===

Depending on the *Approval* task's outcome, two scenarios are possible. To indicate a point with several alternative paths, add an Exclusive Gateway element:

* Select the *Approval* task element and click *Append Gateway* image:quick-start/append-gateway-icon.png[width="20"].
* Select the gateway element and create another user task with image:quick-start/append-task-icon.png[width="20"] -> image:quick-start/change-type-icon.png[width="20"] -> *User Task*.
* Select the gateway and click image:quick-start/append-end-event-icon.png[width="20"] to create `EndEvent` element.
* Select the new sequence flows between elements and name them: `approved` and `rejected`.

The model should now look like this:

image::quick-start/flows.png[align="center"]

* Select the `approved` sequence flow and specify its *Condition* properties:
** *Condition source*: `User task outcome`
** *User task id*: `Approval`
** *User task outcome*: `approve`
+
image::quick-start/flow-approved.png[align="center" width="380"]
+
* Similarly, specify *Condition* properties for the `rejected` sequence flow:
** *Condition source*: `User task outcome`
** *User task id*: `Approval`
** *User task outcome*: `reject`

[[creating-payment-user-task]]
=== Creating Payment User Task

The other user task in our model is to notify accountants about reimbursement payment approval. It will be represented by the <<payment-form, Payment form>> available only to accountants.

* Select the user task on the canvas then set its *Id* and *Name*:
** *Id*: `payment`
** *Name*: Payment

For this task we will implement the following behavior: it is sent to all accountants with any of them being able to claim this task. To achieve this, instead of a particular assignee there is an option to specify *Candidate groups* or *Candidate users*.

Therefore, let's create a *Candidate group* for accountants.

TIP: Before leaving Modeler, save your model as draft with image:quick-start/save-draft-button.png[width="32"] button on the toolbar. You can open it any time later using image:quick-start/open-draft-button.png[width="32"] button.

* Go to the *BPM -> User groups* view and create a new group named `Accountants` and set `accountants` as its code.
* Set the user type to *Users*.
* Add users to the group.
+
image::quick-start/user-group.png[align="center" width="1414"]

NOTE: Users involved in the processes must be granted the `BPM: process actor` role. This role provides access to BPM views and entities required for starting processes and working with user tasks. You can assign roles in the *Application -> Users* view.

* Go back to the modeler and select the `Payment` user task.
* Find the *Candidate groups* property field and click the edit button image:quick-start/edit-button.png[width="32"] next to it.
* In the Candidate group editor, add the `Accountants` group.
+
image::quick-start/groups.png[align="center" width="756"]

* Configure an input dialog for the `Payment` task similarly to `Approval` task. Set the following properties:
** *Form type*: `Input dialog`
** *Open mode*: `Dialog` (this will be set by default)
* Add input parameters. They match the parameters on the Approval form but the comment field should be non-editable too:
+
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Process variable | Caption | Type | Editable | Required

|`requestNumber`
|Request number
|String
|false
|true

|`expenseAmount`
|Expense amount
|Decimal (double)
|false
|true

|`expenseDate`
|Expense Date
|Date
|false
|true

|`document`
|Document
|File
|false
|true

|`comment`
|Comment
|Multiline string
|false
|false

|===
+
* Go back to the canvas and add the `EndEvent` element image:quick-start/append-end-event-icon.png[width="20"] after the `Payment` task.

[[specifying-users-to-start-process]]
=== Specifying Users to Start Process

To start a process the user must belong to a special user group. In our case, such group will contain all users.

* Open the *User groups* view and create a new group with the following properties:

** *Name*: All users
** *Code*: all-users
** *Type*: All users
+
image::quick-start/all-users.png[align="center" width="1392"]

* Go back to the *Modeler* view and click anywhere on the canvas to display the process properties.
* Set *Candidate groups* to `All users` in the *Starter candidates* section.
+
image::quick-start/users-start.png[align="center" width="385"]

[[starting-process]]
== Deploying Process

The process model is ready to be deployed to the process engine.

* Go to the *Modeler* view.
* Click *Deploy process* image:quick-start/deploy-process-button.png[[align="center", width="32"] on the toolbar.
* Open the *BPM -> Start Process* view.

New *Reimbursement* process should now be available on the list. This list provides all deployed processes that the current user can start.

[[testing-process]]
== Testing Process

Now that the process is modeled and deployed it can be started. Let's go through it step by step, observing all the forms we have created.

[[start-form]]
=== Start Form

With the current settings, the process can be started by any user on the *BPM -> Start Process* view.

* Select the *Reimbursement* process and click the *Start process* button.
+
image::quick-start/start-process.png[align="center" width="1392"]
+
* Fill in the fields in the form and click the *Start process* button.
+
image::quick-start/start-form.png[align="center" width="598"]

The assigned manager will then receive an incoming approval task.

[[approval-form]]
=== Approval Form

Let's see how this process looks from the manager's standpoint. On the previous step, manager *james* was assigned to approve the request.

* Log in on behalf of the manager assigned to approve the request.
* Navigate to the *BPM -> My Tasks* view.
* Select the task from the list and click the *Open Task* button.
+
image::quick-start/approval-step.png[align="center" width="1011"]
+
* Review the request, and then click the *Approve* button.
+
image::quick-start/approval-form.png[align="center" width="596"]

Upon approval, the request will be sent to an accountant, who will then take care of payment.

[[payment-form]]
=== Payment Form

Accountants will see reimbursements to be paid in their *Group* tasks.

* Log in on behalf of any user who is a member of the *Accountants* user group.
* Open the *BPM -> My Tasks* view. Expand the *Group tasks* node.
+
image::quick-start/group-task.png[align="center" width="1010"]
+
* Open the task form.
+
image::quick-start/payment-task.png[align="center" width="596"]
+
Fields in this form remain read-only until the task is claimed.
+
* Claim the task using one of the two options:
** Click *Claim and resume* button to proceed with this task right away. This will remove the task from the *Group* list and the *Complete button* will appear.
** Click *Claim and close* to claim the task while postponing its completion. This will close the form and move the task from *Group* tasks to the current user's *Assigned* tasks list. After that the task is no longer visible to other accountants.
+
* Click the *Complete task* button to finish the process. This button is added by default to any task that does not have outcomes specified.
+
image::quick-start/complete-task.png[align="center" width="1392"]

The process is now complete.
