Jmix includes a set of xref:vc/html.adoc[HTML components] for standard HTML elements. If no suitable component is included, or you want to include native HTML directly, use the `html` component. It can render HTML provided as a string, CDATA, or file.

* XML element: `html`

* Java class: `Html`

[[basics]]
== Basics

This example demonstrates how to add HTML content via a string in a message bundle:

image::visual-components/components/html-basic.png[align="center", width="347"]

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=basics]
----

.messages.properties
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/messages_en.properties[tags=html-content]
----

The same HTML block can be added within a CDATA (Character Data) section:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=cdata]
----

This ensures that your HTML code will not be interpreted as part of the XML, allowing it to be displayed correctly.

NOTE: The block must contain exactly one root element such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, or `<div>`. Inside the root element can be any number of nested <div> elements to structure the content.

[[file-content]]
== File Content

The code for HTML block can be also obtained from a file using one of the following methods.

[[static-resource]]
=== Static Resource

The file can be served statically by the application.

NOTE: By default, static content is served from `/static`, `/public`, `/resources`, or `/META-INF/resources` directories of the classpath. See details in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web.servlet.spring-mvc.static-content[Spring Boot documentation^].

If your file is located
at `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/html/html-file.html`, specify it as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=static]
----

[[stream-resource]]
=== Stream Resource

The HTML code can be supplied as a file through the `InputStream` and then the component can be initialized by passing it in.

NOTE: The component cannot be created using the `UiComponents` bean, as it does not provide a no-arguments constructor.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/HtmlView.java[tags=stream]
----

[[css-properties]]
== CSS Properties

Use the xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc#css[css] attribute to add CSS properties declaratively:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=css-attribute]
----
//todo: link to themes section
Alternatively, you can add custom CSS styling within the application's theme.
