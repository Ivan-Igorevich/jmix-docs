== Create dashboard

Dashboard is a single, unified space where you can gather and display multiple charts. Dashboards can be customized by resizing charts, rearranging their layout, and adding new charts.

We will try to create a dashboard that will be available in Jmix application. This dashboard should combine three previous charts that we created.

To create new dashboard navigate to "*Dashboards*" in top menu and create new dashboard clicking on "*+ DASHBOARD*" button.

In the opened screen by default we can see only user's created charts. Let's add them to dashboard in the following order:

Let's name it - "*Users salary*" and save.

After saving dashboard we can configure its settings to enable embedding dashboard.

Click on settings button on the top right and select "*Embed dashboard*" menu item. It will show the dialog with configuration. Click on "*ENABLE EMBEDDING*" button. The Superset generates the "*embedded ID*" of this dashboard that we can use later in Jmix project.

== Embed dashboard into Jmix application

To show created dashboard in Jmix we can use `SupersetDashboard` component. This component requires to specify an embedded ID that we previously enable in dashboard settings.

Let's create a new View named *Salary dashboard* by utilizing the `Blank view` Studio template.

In the View descriptor click on the `layout` element where your dashboard component will be located. To add a `dashbaord` element, choose *Add Component* in the actions panel, select the *SupersetDashboard* item.

This will automatically add the superset namespace to your root tag, if you haven't added it in this file yet.
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<view xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/view"
    xmlns:superset="http://jmix.io/schema/superset/ui" />
----

As well as the `<superset:dashboard/>` element in the `layout`. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<superset:dashboard id="dashboard"
                    width="100%"
                    height="100%"/>
----

And the last step is to specify an embedded ID of dashboard that we get in previous steps. Copy it from Superset dashboard and set to `embeddedId` attribute.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<superset:dashboard id="dashboard"
                    width="100%"
                    height="100%"
                    embeddedId="940f36ff-6c97-4a35-a4ff-4e4aeee3a9c7"/>
----

Once you complete these steps, restart or hot deploy changes you made in View descriptor and refresh the page. As a result of this tutorial is the embedded Superset dashboard in Jmix application.
