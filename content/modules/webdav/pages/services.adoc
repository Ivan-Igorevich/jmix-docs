* Retrieve a document using a document version ID, document ID, document URI, or document version.
* Retrieve a list of documents from a specified document or resource path.
* Create or remove a lock on a document with a defined timeout period.
* Create, update, or delete a document.

[[webdav-document-versions-management-service]]
== WebdavDocumentVersionsManagementService

The service is utilized for managing document versions, providing the following capabilities:

* Retrieving the initial version of a document.
* Obtaining the most recent version of a document.
* Retrieving a specific version of a document
* Retrieving all available versions of a document
* Creating, updating, or deleting document versions

[[webdav-raw-links-management-service]]
== WebdavRawLinksManagementService

The service is used for managing persistent links. Persistent links are stored in the database as instances of the `WebdavLink` entity, pointing to instances of `WebdavDocument` or `WebdavDocumentVersion` entities. The format of the links is as follows: `\http://localhost:8080/app/webdav/link/\{linkIdentifier}`, where the `linkIdentifier` corresponds to the id of the `WebdavLink` entity.

For example, `\http://localhost:8080/app/webdav/link/7a53ce0e-1576-ad32-a131-4abcde6b1235`.

When a link is clicked, a non-persistent link is generated and opened. Each link comes with context, which provides additional information on how to open the file entity that the link references. By default, a link is created with a default (empty) context. This context varies based on the type of entity stored in the link. If the entity type is `WebdavDocument`, the file will be opened with full access mode. If the entity type is `WebdavDocumentVersion`, the file will be opened in read-only access mode. The string value of the link is contained within the `url` field of the `WebdavUrl`.

The service methods provide the capability to establish and delete persistent links to a document with a default, read-only, or custom context.

[[webdav-url-management-service]]
== WebdavUrlManagementService

The service is used for retrieving non-persistent links. These links contain details about the application for opening, access mode, filename, and document version. The link either launches the application for the file stored in the `WebdavDocument`/`WebdavDocumentVersion` entity or initiates a download. For instance: `ms-word:ofv|u|http://localhost:8080/app/webdav/document/0e68df0e-8395-4d25-a230-3eb89e6b2674/example.docx`.

The link's string value is contained within the `url` field of the `WebdavUrl` class. These links are not stored in the database but are dynamically generated.

NOTE: It is recommended to use persistent links from the `WebdavRawLinksManagementService`.

The service offers the following functionalities:

- Obtaining a link to the most recent document version with full access or in read-only mode.
- Obtaining a link to a specific document version with full access or in read-only mode.
- Retrieving details about an external application utilized for opening a document version.
