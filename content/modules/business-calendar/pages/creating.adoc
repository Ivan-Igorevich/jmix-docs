== Creating Business Calendar at Runtime

After the add-on is installed, use the main menu to open the *Business calendars* list view.

When on this page, click the *Create* button to open the *Business calendar editor*.

Specify the following parameters:

* *Name* – human-readable description of the given calendar.
* *Code* – unique identifier of the given calendar.

The next step is to define working days and hours while excluding non-working time, such as holidays, vacations, or any other time off work. For this, use the editor's tabs described below.

=== Holidays

On the *Holidays* tab, click *Create* to add holidays and weekends.

The add-on supports the following types of holidays:

* *Day of week* – allows to set holidays on certain days of week. For example, for many people, the standard weekend is Saturday and Sunday:

* *Specific date holiday* – allows to set a holiday on an exact date. For example, some holidays fall on a different day every year to allow people a long weekend:

* *Annual holiday* – allows to schedule recurring holidays that are celebrated on the same day every year, such as _New Year's Day_.

* *Cron-based holiday* – allows specifying holidays in the quartz CRON format. See http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron trigger tutorial^] for more information.

It can help adding some nontrivial holidays, like the _Third Friday of every month_ or the _First Monday of July_, etc.

=== Working Schedule

On the *Working schedule* tab, you can specify working hours for each day of the week. There can be several working periods per day, but they should not overlap.

=== Additional Business Days

On the *Additional business days* tab, you can set days that you want to always be treated business days. If such a date coincides with a holiday, it will still be a workday. There is an option to set different working hours.

[[business-calendars-design-time]]
== Creating Business Calendar at Design Time

Use annotated Java interface to create a business calendar at design time. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/calendars-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/calendarsex1/calendars/SampleBusinessCalendar.java[tags=business-calendar]
----

<1> Annotated business calendar is an interface annotated with the `@BusinessCalendar` annotation. You should specify the following parameters for the `@BusinessCalendar` annotation:
* `name` – a human-readable description of a given calendar;
* `code` – a unique identifier of a given calendar.
<2> Specify holiday in the quartz CRON format.
<3> Specify holiday for days of the week.
<4> Specify holiday for a specific date.
<5> Specify holiday for an annually recurring date.
<6> Specify scheduled business days.
<7> Specify additional business days.

A business calendar created at the design time is displayed in the list of all business calendars and is available only for viewing.
