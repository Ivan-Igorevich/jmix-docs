= Entity Log

Entity Log is a mechanism for monitoring changes made to JPA entities within a system. It records changes in entity attributes and provides a user interface for querying and displaying details regarding the changes:

* What entity instance was changed.
* Old and new values of changed attributes.
* When the entity was changed.
* Which user changed the entity.

== Registering Changes

Entity Log automatically monitors changes made to JPA entities upon saving through xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] or xref:data-access:entity-manager.adoc[EntityManager]. It is not operational when native SQL is utilized.

Another approach is utilizing the `EntityLog` bean to log changes in entities directly from your application code. In this case, invoke `registerCreate()`, `registerModify()` and `registerDelete()` methods with the `auto` parameter set to `false`. When the entity log is called automatically by the framework, this parameter is set to `true`.

== Setting Up Entity Log

NOTE: To be able to use the administrative UI at runtime, a user must have the `entity-log` resource role provided by the Audit add-on.

You can configure the entity log in the *Audit -> Entity Log* view. Switch to the *Setup* tab:

To establish entity log configuration, click the *Create* button.

Choose the entity from the *Name* drop-down list and select the attributes for auditing.

The *Auto* checkbox determines whether the system logs changes when `EntityLog` is invoked with the `auto = true` parameter (triggered by entity listeners).

The *Manual* checkbox determines whether the system logs changes when `EntityLog` is invoked with the `auto = false` parameter.

The *Export* and *Import* actions allow you to export and import configurations in JSON or ZIP format.

Also, you can set up entity log by entering some records in the database if you want to include the configuration to the database initialization.

Logging configuration involves the `LoggedEntity` and `LoggedAttribute` entities, which correspond to the `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

`LoggedEntity` specifies the entity types to be logged.

`LoggedAttribute` defines the entity attribute to be logged and contains a link to the `LoggedEntity` and the attribute name.

To configure logging for a specific entity, insert the corresponding entries into the `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

For instance, in the following example, logging changes to the `phone` attribute of the `Customer` entity is configured during database initialization:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/audit-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/liquibase/changelog/2024/02/21-153813-a38a565c.xml[tags=changelog]
----

[[view]]
== Viewing Entity Log

To access the content of the entity log, navigate to the *View* tab within the *Audit â†’ Entity Log* view. Configure the required filters to locate specific log entries.

Additionally, you can access the log entries for a particular entity from any application view.

Log entries are stored in the `AUDIT_ENTITY_LOG` table corresponding to the `EntityLogItem` entity. Changed attribute values are stored in the `CHANGES` column and are converted to instances of `EntityLogAttr` entity.

For instance, in the following example, an `Order` detail view displays data grids containing the entity log information.

Below is an excerpt from the view's XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/audit-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/demo/view/order/order-detail-view.xml[tags=order-xml]
----
<1> Loading a collection of `EntityLogItem` into the `entityLogItemsDc` data container.
<2> Loading associated `EntityLogAttr` instances into the `entityLogAttrDc` data container.
<3> Binding a data grid to the `entityLogItemsDc` container.
<4> Binding a data grid to the `entityLogAttrDc` container.

`Order` view controller looks like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/audit-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/view/order/OrderDetailView.java[tags=order-java]
----
<1> In the `ItemChangeEvent` handler of the `orderDc` container, a parameter is set to the dependent loader and it is triggered.
