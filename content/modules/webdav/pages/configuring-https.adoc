= 3. Configuring to Work with Desktop Applications

To authenticate desktop applications, the server must have HTTPS enabled. Here are simple instructions for configuring HTTPS in your development environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates are suitable solely for testing purposes. When running production applications, it's essential to utilize SSL certificates issued by a trusted authority.
====

[[keystore-file]]
== Creating a Keystore File

. Generate a keystore using the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html[keytool utility^] provided by JDK:
+
[source,text]
----
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias localhost -keystore localhost.jks -validity 365 -keysize 2048
----
+
You will be asked for the keystore password and then for some names. Remember the password and the names.

. Export certificate from the keystore:
+
[source,text]
----
keytool -export -keystore localhost.jks -storepass <password> -alias localhost -file localhost.cer
----
+
Use the password entered on the first step instead of `<password>`.

. Register the certificate as trusted in your operating system.
+
* On Windows operating system:
+
1. Press the `Windows` key + `R` to open the *Run* dialog, then type `"certmgr.msc"` and press *Enter*. This will open the *Certificate Manager*.

2. In the left pane of the *Certificate Manager*, expand the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* folder.

3. Right-click on the folder and select *All Tasks > Import...* from the context menu. This will open the *Certificate Import Wizard*.

4. In the *Certificate Import Wizard*, click *Next* and then browse to the location where your certificate file is stored. Select the certificate file and click *Next*.

5. Choose the option to place the certificate in the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* store and click *Next*.

6. Review the information and click *Finish* to complete the import process.

7. You should see a message indicating that the import was successful. Click *OK* to close the wizard.
+
Once these steps are completed, the certificate should be registered as trusted in the Windows operating system.
* On macOS:
1. Double-click on `localhost.cer` file in Finder. The *Keychain Access* application will open.
2. Find your certificate under the name entered on the first step as "your first and last name" on the *Certificates* tab.
3. Double-click the certificate and select *Trust -> When using this certificate: Always Trust*.

[[configuring-server]]
== Configuring Server

This section explains how to use the certificate generated in the previous section in your application when it runs from the IDE or as an executable JAR.

. Create `src/main/resources/<base-package>/keystore` directory and copy `localhost.jks` into it.

. Set the following properties in the `application.properties` file replacing `<base-package>` and `<password>` with actual values:
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
# Enables HTTPS
server.ssl.enabled=true
# The format used for the keystore
server.ssl.key-store-type = JKS
# The path to the keystore containing the certificate
server.ssl.key-store = classpath:<base-package>/keystore/localhost.jks
# The password used to generate the keystore
server.ssl.key-store-password = <password>
# The alias mapped to the certificate
server.ssl.key-alias = localhost

# Changes the server's port
server.port = 8443
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `<base-package>` in the path to the keystore (`server.ssl.key-store` property) should be presented as a slash-separated path:
----
server.ssl.key-store = classpath:com/example/demo/keystore/localhost.jks
----
====
. Open the main application class and change the `printApplicationUrl()` method. The URL should be changed to `https://` after configuring HTTPS:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@EventListener
    public void printApplicationUrl(final ApplicationStartedEvent event) {
        LoggerFactory.getLogger(DemoApplication.class).info("Application started at "
                + "https://localhost:"
                + environment.getProperty("local.server.port")
                + Strings.nullToEmpty(environment.getProperty("server.servlet.context-path")));
    }
----

[[running-application]]
== Running the Application

After following the instructions outlined above, launch the application at `++https://localhost:8443++`.

Choose the *Knowledge base* item from the *Application* menu. Click on the WebDAV document link.

The browser will display a dialog prompting the user to open the WebDAV file in a desktop office application.

image::open-webdav-doc2.png[align="center", width="1432"]

Agree to open the file and ensure that the WebDAV document opens in desktop office applications.

Once the WebDAV document is edited and saved, a new version of the document will be created, which will be the latest version.

[[summary]]
== Summary

You have learned that:

* To enable opening and editing of WebDAV documents using desktop office applications, it is necessary to set up HTTPS for your web application. This is essential for ensuring secure communication between desktop office applications and the WebDAV server, particularly when handling sensitive document editing and saving operations.
* HTTPS encryption provides a secure channel for transmitting data, preventing unauthorized access and guaranteeing the integrity of the document editing process.
