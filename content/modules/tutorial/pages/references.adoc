= 3. References and Unique Attributes

The next feature of your Onboarding application is the management of Departments.

New hire belongs to a Department. Each department has a unique name and a reference to HR Manager.

In this chapter, you will create:

* The `Department` entity with the link to `User`.
* A database table with a foreign key and a unique constraint.
* CRUD views including UI component for selecting the related entity.

[[create-entity]]
== Creating Department Entity

The `Department` entity has the `name` (unique) attribute and the `hrManager` attribute which is a reference to the `User` entity:

image::references/references-diagram.svg[align="center"]

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:common/add.svg[]) -> *JPA Entity* as you did in the xref:simple-crud.adoc#create-entity[previous chapter]. In the *New JPA Entity* dialog, enter `Department` into the *Class* field and select the *Traits* -> *Versioned* checkbox:

image::references/create-entity-1.png[align="center",width=492]

Click *OK*.

Studio will create the entity class and open the entity designer:

image::references/create-entity-2.png[align="center"]

[[create-unique-attr]]
=== Creating Unique Attribute

Let's add the `name` attribute to the entity.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `name` into the *Name* field and select the *Mandatory* checkbox:

image::references/create-entity-3.png[align="center"]

Now let's define a unique constraint for the `NAME` column in the database. It will ensure there will be no departments with the same name.

Switch to the *Indexes* tab at the bottom and click *New Index* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Database Indexes* toolbar. Studio will add a row to the indexes list:

image::references/create-entity-4.png[align="center"]

Select `NAME` in the *Available attributes* list and click image:common/arrow-right.svg[] in the toolbar to move it to the *Selected attributes*.

Select the *Unique* and *Constraint* checkboxes in the index row and change the name to `IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME`:

image::references/create-entity-5.png[align="center"]

If you switch to the *Text* tab of the entity designer, you will see the unique constraint added to the `@Table` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JmixEntity
@Table(name = "DEPARTMENT", uniqueConstraints = {
        @UniqueConstraint(name = "IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME", columnNames = {"NAME"})
})
@Entity
public class Department {
    // ...
----

Using this annotation, Studio will add a unique constraint for the database table to the Liquibase changelog.

[[create-reference-attr]]
=== Creating Reference Attribute

Now create a reference to an HR Manager of the department.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `hrManager` into the *Name* field. Then select:

* *Attribute type*: `ASSOCIATION`
* *Type*: `User`
* *Cardinality*: *Many to One*

image::references/create-entity-6.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

You can find the new attribute on the *Text* tab:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JoinColumn(name = "HR_MANAGER_ID")
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private User hrManager;
----

Also, the `@Table` annotation on the class header now defines the index for the foreign key column:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@JmixEntity
@Table(name = "DEPARTMENT", indexes = {
        @Index(name = "IDX_DEPARTMENT_HR_MANAGER", columnList = "HR_MANAGER_ID")
    },
    // ...
----

You can see it on the *Indexes* tab too.

[[create-screens]]
== Creating CRUD Views

Let's generate CRUD views for the `Department` entity.

Click *Views* -> *Create view* in the actions panel at the top of the entity designer:

image::references/create-screens-1.png[align="center", width="487"]

On the first step of the view creation wizard, select the `Entity list and detail views` template:

image::common/screen-wizard-1.png[align="center"]

Click *Next*.

Accept the suggested values on the first two steps of the wizard.

On the *Entity list view fetch plan* step, add the `hrManager` attribute to the selection:

image::references/create-screens-2.png[align="center"]

Now you can be sure that the referenced `User` entity will be loaded together with the root `Department` entity and displayed in the list view.

CAUTION: If an attribute is not present in the fetch plan, Studio doesn't create a visual component for it in the generated views.

Click *Next*.

On the next *Entity detail view fetch plan* step, this attribute will be selected automatically:

image::references/create-screens-3.png[align="center"]

Click *Next*.

Accept the values on the *Localizable messages* step and click *Create*.

Studio will generate two views: `Department.list` and `Department.detail` and open their source code. Close all editor tabs for now - you will make some changes in the generated views later in this chapter.

[[run-app]]
== Running the Application

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before running the application, Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog:

image::references/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the changelog contains commands for creating the `DEPARTMENT` table, a unique constraint for the `NAME` column and the foreign key and the index for the `HR_MANAGER_ID` column.

Click *Save and run*.

Studio will execute the changelog, then build and run the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Departments` item in the `Application` menu. You will see the `Department.list` view:

image::references/run-app-2.png[align="center"]

Click *Create*. The `Department.detail` view will open:

image::references/run-app-3.png[align="center"]

You can select an HR Manager for the department by clicking the ellipsis button in the picker field. The users list view will open in a dialog window. Select a row in the users table and scroll down to reveal the *Select* button:

image::references/run-app-4.png[align="center"]

Select a user and click *Select*. The user will be displayed in the picker field:

image::references/run-app-5.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*. The referenced user will be displayed in the table too:

image::references/run-app-6.png[align="center"]

[[instance-name]]
=== Observing the Instance Name

You may wonder why the picker field and the table show the `[admin]` string for the selected user?

Jmix has a concept of _instance name_: a human-readable text that represents an entity instance. It can be defined for any entity using the `@InstanceName` annotation on a field or a method.

The `User` entity generated by the project template has the following method defining the instance name:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class User implements JmixUserDetails, HasTimeZone {
    // ...

    @InstanceName
    @DependsOnProperties({"firstName", "lastName", "username"})
    public String getDisplayName() {
        return String.format("%s %s [%s]", (firstName != null ? firstName : ""),
                (lastName != null ? lastName : ""), username).trim();
    }
----

So when the `firstName` and `lastName` are empty, the `User` instance name is `username` in square brackets, which is what you see in the application at the moment.

The Studio entity designer automatically generates the `@InstanceName` annotation if it encounters an appropriately named attribute: `name`, `description`, etc. For example, your `Department` entity has `@InstanceName` on its `name` attribute:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Department {
    // ...

    @InstanceName
    @Column(name = "NAME", nullable = false)
    @NotNull
    private String name;
----

So the department's name will be displayed in UI if you use a department as a reference in another entity. You will see it later in the tutorial.

The entity designer also helps you to define the instance name manually. You can select an attribute for it or generate a method using the *Instance name* field and the button next to it:

image::references/instance-name-1.png[align="center", width="475"]

[[customize-ui]]
== Simple UI Customizations

Let's make some customizations in the application UI to become more familiar with Jmix features.

[[change-attr-caption]]
=== Changing Attribute Caption

Perhaps you have noticed that the generated caption for the `hrManager` attribute is not quite correct: it reads `Hr manager`. Let's change it to `HR Manager`.

Select the `hrManager` attribute in the entity designer and click the globe  (image:common/globe.svg[]) button next to the attribute name:

image::references/change-caption-1.png[align="center"]

The *Localized Message* dialog will appear:

image::references/change-caption-2.png[align="center", width="616"]

Change the text and click *OK*.

You can view and edit all messages of your project if you double-click the *User Interface* -> *Message Bundle* node in the *Jmix* tool window. The message that you have just changed is highlighted below:

image::references/change-caption-3.png[align="center",width="914"]

Switch to the application running in your web browser. Refresh the web page. You will see the new caption for the `hrManager` attribute.

[TIP]
====
Thanks to the Studio _hot deploy_ feature, you don't have to restart the application when making changes in the UI.

Just save the changes in the IDE (press `Ctrl/Cmd+S`), wait a couple of seconds and refresh the web page.
====

[[sorting-in-datagrid]]
=== Sorting in DataGrid

By default, users can sort data grid by a single column. Let's enable sorting by multiple columns.

Find `department-list-view.xml` in the *Jmix* tool window and double-click it. The view designer appears:

image::references/customize-ui-1.png[align="center"]

Studio allows you to preview the layout right inside the IDE. Click the *Start Preview* button:

image::references/customize-ui-2.png[align="center"]

Studio will build the frontend and after a few seconds you will see the preview panel next to the source code. Depending on your display resolution, you may want to show only the XML editor or the preview at a time. Use the buttons on top of the editor panel to switch the mode:

image::references/customize-ui-3.png[align="center"]

Locate `departmentsDataGrid` in the *Jmix UI* structure panel. The component will be selected in the preview, in the XML editor and in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel in the lower right corner:

image::references/customize-ui-4.png[align="center"]

Select the checkbox for the `multiSort` property:

image::references/customize-ui-5.png[align="center",width="348"]

Studio will add the `multiSort="true"` attribute for the `dataGrid` XML element.

TIP: It works in the opposite direction too. You can edit the XML directly and view the results in the designer panels and Preview.

Switch to the running application and refresh the page with the Departments list view. Test the sorting by click on the Name column, then on the HR Manager column.

[[change-unique-constraint-message]]
=== Changing Unique Constraint Violation Message

If you try to create another department with the same name, you will see the error message about the unique constraint violation:

image::references/customize-ui-8.png[align="center"]

The default message is not very user-friendly, but you can easily change it.

Double-click the *User Interface* -> *Message Bundle* node in the *Jmix* tool window and add the following line:

[source,properties]
----
databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.IDX_DEPARTMENT_UNQ_NAME=A department with the same name already exists
----

The message key should start with `databaseUniqueConstraintViolation.` and end with the name of the database unique constraint. You may notice that the file already contains a similar message for the unique constraint on the `username` attribute of the `User` entity.

Switch to the application and test your changes. Now the error shows your message:

image::references/customize-ui-9.png[align="center"]

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have built the second feature: management of departments.

You have learned that:

* Studio helps to create reference attributes and generates xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc[Liquibase changelogs] with a foreign key and an index.

* To show a reference attribute in an entity list or detail view, it should be included in the xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[fetch plan] of the view.

* The xref:data-model:entities.adoc#instance-name[instance name] is used to show a reference in UI.

* The xref:flow-ui:vc/components/entityPicker.adoc[] component is used by default to select a reference in a generated detail view.

* The xref:data-model:entities.adoc#uniqueness[uniqueness of entity attributes] is maintained on the database level by defining unique constraints.

* A xref:flow-ui:exception-handlers.adoc#unique-constraint-violation-handler[unique constraint violation] message can be easily customized.

* Captions and messages generated by Studio are stored in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle] of the application.

* Studio xref:studio:hot-deploy.adoc[hot deploys] changes in views and messages to the running application, which saves from restarting the application when developing UI. Changes in entities are not hot deployed.
