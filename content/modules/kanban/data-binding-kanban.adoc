== Create KanbanTask Entity and Views

To start, you'll need to generate a `KanbanStatus` enumeration consisting of the following values:

* `Todo`
* `In progress`
* `Verification`
* `Done`

The detailed instructions for creating enumerations can be found in the xref:tutorial:enumerations.adoc[Using Enumerations] section of Tutorial.
