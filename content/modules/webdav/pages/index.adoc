= WebDAV

The main purpose of the WebDAV add-on is to facilitate access to files stored in the xref:files:file-storage.adoc[file storage] via the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV[WebDAV protocol^]. This feature enables users to conveniently open and edit files using desktop applications (such as Word, Excel, LibreOffice, etc.) without the necessity of repeatedly downloading and uploading files to the web application.

Additionally, the add-on offers the following supplementary functionalities:

* Document version control. Enabling versioning for a document ensures that a new version is generated on the server each time the document is modified.

* Customizable conflict resolution policies to support collaborative document editing.

* Ability to manage document access permissions.

* UI components for managing files and document versions.

* Integration with external systems through static links for seamless file access.
