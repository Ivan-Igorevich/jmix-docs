* Embed dashboard into Jmix application

== Create a dashboard

Dashboard is a single, unified space where you can gather and display multiple charts. Dashboards can be customized by resizing charts, rearranging their layout, and adding new charts.

We will try to create a dashboard that will be available in Jmix application. This dashboard should combine three previous charts that we created.

To create new dashboard navigate to *Dashboards* in top menu and create new dashboard clicking on *+ DASHBOARD* button.

In the opened screen by default we can see only user's created charts.

 * Add created charts to dashboard in the following order:

 * Enter the name of dashboard - `Employees' salaries` and save.

After saving dashboard we can configure its settings to enable embedding dashboard.

 * Click on settings button on the top right and select *Embed dashboard* menu item.

It will show the dialog with configuration.

 * Click on *ENABLE EMBEDDING* button. The Superset generates the *embedded ID* of this dashboard that we can use later in Jmix project.

== Embed dashboard into Jmix application

To show created dashboard in Jmix we can use `SupersetDashboard` component. This component requires to specify an embedded ID that we previously enable in dashboard settings.

* Let's create a new View named *Salaries dashboard* by utilizing the `Blank view` Studio template.

* In the View descriptor click on the `layout` element where your dashboard component will be located.
* To add a `dashbaord` element, choose *Add Component* in the actions panel, select the *SupersetDashboard* item.

This will automatically add the superset namespace to your root tag, if you haven't added it in this file yet.
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<view xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/view"
    xmlns:superset="http://jmix.io/schema/superset/ui" />
----

As well as the `<superset:dashboard/>` element in the `layout`.

* Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as follows:
    - id = dashboard
    - height = 100%
    - width = 100%

And the last step is to specify an embedded ID of dashboard that we got in previous steps.

* Copy it from Superset dashboard and set to `embeddedId` attribute.

The configured component should be as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$superset-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/salariesdashboard/salaries-dashboard-view.xml[tags=dashboard]
----

* Once you complete these steps, restart or hot deploy the changes you made in the view descriptor and refresh the page.

As a result of following this tutorial, you will have the embedded Superset dashboard in your Jmix application.
