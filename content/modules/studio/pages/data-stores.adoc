= Data Stores

When a Jmix application is created, the main xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc[data store] already exists and can be accessed from the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

By double-clicking, you can open the properties dialog of the data store. By default, HSQLDB is set as a database type.

[[database-properties]]
image::data-properties.png[align="center",width="851"]

The following properties are available both for the main and additional data stores:

* *Database type* - type of the database server. You can select one of the available databases from the list.
* *Database URL* - a host, port, and database name.
** *Connection params* - other connection parameters. The format of the connection parameters depends on the selected DBMS. The string should include a separator between the database name and parameters. You can use the pencil button in the right part of the *Connection params* field to enter connection parameters conveniently. In this case, Studio automatically forms the connection string by adding DBMS-specific separator characters.

** *Show raw URL* - shows connection parameters as URL.
** *Integrated Security* - enables the corresponding authentication option when connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server 2012+ database.
* *Database user* and *Password* - database connection credentials.

If you use xref:studio:profile-specific-properties.adoc[profile-specific configuration files], the xref:studio:data-stores.adoc[Data Store Properties] editor will read and write properties to and from the profile instead of `application.properties`.

You can use placeholders of the following type `${VAR:default_value}` where VAR is an environment variable to set database properties.

Studio resolves the placeholders and uses the resulting values for all operations with the database: test connection, recreate, update, Liquibase diff, and so on.

*Supported DB Types* section contains the *Enable support for several DB types* checkbox. If this checkbox is activated, you can select more than one supported databases. Studio will generate one set of Liquibase migration scripts supporting all selected database types.

*Database Identifiers Length Mode* section allows you to select one of the three available modes:

* *Oracle* - maximum 30 symbols length of tables, columns, indexes, other names.
* *Postgres* - maximum 64 symbols length of tables, columns, indexes, other names.
* *Unlimited* - unlimited length of tables, columns, indexes, other names.


[[additional-data-store]]
== Additional Data Store

To create additional data store, use <<data-store-actions,an action>> from the context menu. Another way is to select the one from  *Advanced*:

See the description of the <<database-properties, database properties>> common for both the main and additional data stores above.

[[db-schema-management]]
image::data-schema.png[align="center",width="776"]

For the additional data store, specify *Data store name* and select an option in the *DB Schema Management* section:

* *Disabled* - Studio doesnâ€™t track database schema changes for this data store. This is the default mode.
* *Update Only* - provides the Update action and creates Liquibase changelogs. 
* *Create and Update* - provides the Update and Recreate actions and creates Liquibase scripts.

[[unsupported-database]]
=== Connecting to Unsupported Databases

You can define an additional data store connected to a database not supported by Jmix natively.

This feature is currently in the preview state and disabled by default. To enable it, press `Shift` twice, select the *Jmix Features* item in the opened list and check the *Generic Database Support for Additional Data Store* checkbox.

After enabling it, when you create an additional data store, you will see the `Generic DB` option in the *Database type* dropdown. If you select this option, Studio will allow you to enter the following parameters:

* *DBMS type* - an arbitrary identifier of the database type, used also as a prefix for the database-specific classes (explained below). Enter a short string containing only lowercase alphanumeric characters, for example, `foo`.
* *Database URL* - the full JDBC connection URL, for example, `jdbc:foosql://localhost/database`.
* *Driver class name* - the class name of the JDBC driver, for example `org.foosql.Driver`.
* *Driver artifact* - JDBC driver artifact coordinates, for example, `org.foosql:foosql:1.0.0`.
* *Connection test query* - an SQL query for testing the connection, for example, `select 1`.
* *Database platform* - a class extending `org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.DatabasePlatform` which describes the database for the EclipseLink ORM framework. You can select an existing class if it suits your database or choose the `Create DatabasePlatform class` option to create a new class.

Click *OK*.

Studio will create the usual `Myds1StoreConfiguration` class with the required beans in the base package. It will also create the following stubs in the `<base-package>/dbms` package:

* `FooPlatform` - a class extending `DatabasePlatform`. It describes the database for the EclipseLink ORM framework.
* `FooDbmsFeatures` - a class implementing the `DbmsFeatures` interface. It describes the database for the Jmix framework.
* `FooSequenceSupport` - a class implementing the `SequenceSupport` interface. It describes how sequences should be handled in this database.
* `FooDbTypeConverter` - a class implementing the `DbTypeConverter` interface. It defines methods for converting data between Java objects and JDBC parameters and results.

Studio will also add the `org.foosql:foosql:1.0.0` dependency to your `build.gradle` file.

Now you should implement the methods in the generated stubs appropriately. Use framework classes like `JmixPostgreSQLPlatform`, `PostgresqlDbmsFeatures`, and so on as examples.

[[data-store-actions]]
== Data Store Actions

By right-clicking the data store item in the Jmix project tree, you can open its context menu:

image::data-actions.png[align="center",width="623"]

The number of actions shown in the menu depends on the data store type and DB schema management mode.

* *New -> Additional Data Store* - opens the dialog for creating a new data store.
* *New -> Liquibase Changelog* - generates a new xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc#changelogs[changelog] file with a correct name.
* *Manage Data Store* - opens the dialog to edit data store settings.
* *Delete Data Store* - removes the data store along with all associated configuration files and Liquibase changelogs.
* *Recreate* - recreates database belonging to the selected data store. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Create and Update* <<db-schema-management,schema management>> type.
* *Update* - updates database schema for the selected data store. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Update Only* and *Create and Update* schema management types.
* *Generate Liquibase Changelog* - generates changelog files for the selected data store by comparing data model with the database schema. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Update Only* and *Create and Update* schema management types.
+
include::subscription-note.adoc[]
* *Check Liquibase Changelog Includes* - checks that includes in the root changelog correspond to the add-ons used in the project. If there is a mismatch, Studio shows a notification dialog and suggests adding or removing includes.
* *Aggregate Liquibase Changelogs* - allows you to combine multiple recent changelogs into a single file, eliminating duplicate actions within changesets.
+
This feature can be used by developers before each commit to a shared code repository. It helps to maintain a tidy collection of changelogs and reduces the application startup time due to fewer changesets.
+
The *Aggregate Liquibase Changelogs* action launches a wizard that enables the developer to customize the aggregated changelog.
* *Generate Model from Database* - xref:studio:reverse-engineering.adoc[generates a data model] from a database.
* *Jump to Source* - opens a Spring configuration class.
