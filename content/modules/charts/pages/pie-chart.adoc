= Pie Chart

In this section, you will:

* Create a pie chart
* Add a `formatter` attribute
* Bind data through a data provider

[[series]]
== Pie Chart Setup

You will integrate a pie chart component to display the distribution of users across different onboarding statuses for a snapshot of the onboarding progress within the organization.

Click on the `formLayout` element in `user-list-view.xml`.

Next, choose *Add Component* in the actions panel, locate and select the *Chart* item. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]

----

To include the `pie` series to your chart, choose the `chart` element and pick *Add -> Series -> Pie*. Add a `name` attribute for the pie chart: `Onboarding Status` and add a `radius` attribute to configure the size of your pie as follows.

[[formatter]]
== Formatting Value

The https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-pie.label.formatter[`formatter`^] attribute in the pie series supports string template and callback functions to format data.

To display the onboarding status and the percentage of users in that status in each slice of the pie chart, select the `label` element, then choose *Add -> Label*.

Set the `formatter` attribute under the `label` attribute to `"\{b} : %\{d}"`, where:

* `\{b}`: Represents the name of the data item (category) - in this context, it's the onboarding status like "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed."
* `\{d}`: Represents the percentage of the total that this data item (category) constitutes.

[[data-binding]]
== Data Binding Using Data Provider

The `pie` chart should display onboarding statuses in percentages. The data isn't directly sourced from a single entity attribute but requires aggregation based on user statuses.

That's why you'll need a data provider to pass aggregated data to the `DataSet` in the controller.

Navigate to the controller class by selecting *Controller* and inject the `pie` chart component into your controller class to interact with the chart component programmatically.

----

To handle data when the view initializes, create an `InitEvent` handler.

Within the `onInit` method, you'll retrieve users according to their onboarding status, count each user group, and pass this information to the `DataSet` class.

Use `DataManager` to load  the total number of users within each onboarding status category as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserListView.java[tags=userLists]
----

Next, create `ListChartItems` to store the chart data. Create `MapDataItem` instances for each onboarding status, mapping the status name to its count.

Bind the prepared data items to the pie chart. As with the `dataSet` XML element, define `categoryField` as the status name and `valueField` as the list size.

You should get the following method by the end of this tutorial.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/user/UserListView.java[tags=onInit]
----

This pie chart visualizes the percent of employees by onboarding status.
