= Features and Geometries

`GeoMap` supports the following features:

* <<marker-feature,MarkerFeature>>
* <<point-feature,PointFeature>>
* <<line-string-feature,LineStringFeature>>
* <<polygon-feature,PolygonFeature>>

[[marker-feature]]
== MarkerFeature

Marker feature represents a marker element with predefined <<point-geometry,PointGeometry>>. It is displayed with marker icon in a map component.

The following example demonstrates how to create and place a marker on a map:

[[point-feature]]
== PointFeature

Point feature represents a point with predefined <<point-geometry,PointGeometry>>. It is displayed as a point with default style. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_Feature-Feature.html[Feature documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to create and place a point on a map:

[[line-string-feature]]
== LineStringFeature

`LineStringFeature` represents a linear feature on a map, typically drawn as a polyline connecting multiple points. The polyline feature comes with a predefined <<line-string-geometry,LineStringGeometry>>. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_Feature-Feature.html[Feature documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to create and place a polyline on a map:

[[polygon-feature]]
== PolygonFeature

`PolygonFeature` represents a closed geometric shape on a map that defines an area or region. This feature is used to display and work with polygons, which are defined by a collection of interconnected points forming a closed loop. The polygon feature comes with a predefined <<polygon-geometry,PolygonGeometry>>. For more details see https://openlayers.org/en/v8.1.0/apidoc/module-ol_Feature-Feature.html[Feature documentation^].

The following example demonstrates how to create and place a polygon on a map:

[[point-geometry]]
== PointGeometry

`PointGeometry` is an object that contains `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Point` object from the JTS library.

[[line-string-geometry]]
== LineStringGeometry

`LineStringGeometry` is an object that contains `org.locationtech.jts.geom.LineString` object from the JTS library.

[[polygon-geometry]]
== PolygonGeometry

`PolygonGeometry` is an object that contains `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Polygon` object from the JTS library.
