= Dataset

In this section, you will create a database connection and a dataset in Apache Superset.

[[database-connection]]
== Create Database Connection

When Superset is started, you can create a connection to the database that contains data for dashboards. In the previous steps, when you configured Superset containers in `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` file, you created the `jmix_database` service which starts the `PostgreSQL`. This database is used in the Jmix application, and now you will configure a connection to this database in Superset.

Click on the *Database Connections* item in Superset settings:

Create new database connection. In the opened dialog, select `PostgreSQL` type and enter connection details:

Click to *CONNECT* button and then to *FINISH* button. Now the connection to the `jmix_database` service is created.

[[dataset]]
== Create Dataset

In Apache Superset, a dataset refers to a collection of data that can be used for creating charts. It can be either a physical dataset, which represents a table or view in a database, or a virtual dataset, which is a query that can be saved and reused as a dataset.

In the Onboarding database, the `USER_` table has a foreign key to `DEPARTMENT`. To visualize users data by departments, you have to use the second option - a query that will be reused as a dataset.

In the top menu, navigate to *SQL* and select *SQL Lab*. In the opened screen fill the fields as follows:

* *DATABASE*: `Jmix Onboarding`
* *SCHEMA*: `public`

Now you should write a query that will be used as a dataset. Since you need a dashboard to visualize employee salaries including the department of each employee, you need to select the following columns:

- user's full name
- department
- salary

So the resulting query will look like this:

[source, SQL]
----
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) full_name, dpr.name department_name, usr.salary
FROM public.user_ usr
INNER join department dpr on usr.department_id = dpr.id
----

Use `INNER JOIN` here to avoid users without department (`admin` user). If you run this query you will see the following result:

Save the query and call it *Employees' salaries*.
