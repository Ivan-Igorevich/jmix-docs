== Configuring HTTPS

To authenticate desktop applications, the server must have HTTPS enabled. Here are simple instructions for configuring HTTPS in your development environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates are suitable solely for testing purposes. When running production applications, it's essential to utilize SSL certificates issued by a trusted authority.
====

[[keystore-file]]
=== Creating a Keystore File

. Generate a keystore using the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html[keytool utility^] provided by JDK:
+
[source,text]
----
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias localhost -keystore localhost.jks -validity 365 -keysize 2048
----
+
You will be asked for the keystore password and then for some names. Remember the password and the names.

. Export certificate from the keystore:
+
[source,text]
----
keytool -export -keystore localhost.jks -storepass <password> -alias localhost -file localhost.cer
----
+
Use the password entered on the first step instead of `<password>`.

. Register the certificate as trusted in your operating system.
+
* On Windows operating system:
+
1. Press the `Windows` key + `R` to open the *Run* dialog, then type `"certmgr.msc"` and press *Enter*. This will open the *Certificate Manager*.

2. In the left pane of the *Certificate Manager*, expand the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* folder.

3. Right-click on the folder and select *All Tasks > Import...* from the context menu. This will open the *Certificate Import Wizard*.

4. In the *Certificate Import Wizard*, click *Next* and then browse to the location where your certificate file is stored. Select the certificate file and click *Next*.

5. Choose the option to place the certificate in the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* store and click *Next*.

6. Review the information and click *Finish* to complete the import process.

7. You should see a message indicating that the import was successful. Click *OK* to close the wizard.
+
Once these steps are completed, the certificate should be registered as trusted in the Windows operating system.
* On macOS:
1. Double-click on `localhost.cer` file in Finder. The *Keychain Access* application will open.
2. Find your certificate under the name entered on the first step as "your first and last name" on the *Certificates* tab.
3. Double-click the certificate and select *Trust -> When using this certificate: Always Trust*.

=== Generate trusted certificate

Some use cases like opening WebDAV files in recent LibreOffice and Firefox versions may not work with self-signed certificates. Trusted
certificates can be obtained from SSL-providers or generated with `certbot`. But for the development purposes you can issue
your own root certificate and sign development server's certificate with it. To simplify this task we recommend to use
`mkcert` generation/maintenance tool. You can skip this section in case you are ok with HTTPS warnings and restrictions.

. Install `mkcert` from the following repo: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert[https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert].
You can build it either from source (requires golang to be installed) and copy binary to `/usr/local/bin` or use binaries provided by vendor.

. Once having `mkcert` in path you can generate and install root certificate:

    mkcert -install

. Navigate to keystore directory and create signed certificates for your development server:

    mkcert -pkcs12 localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

. Create `.jks` keystore file with certificates for your project:

    keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore localhost+2.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore localhost.jks

[[configuring-server]]
=== Configuring Server

This section explains how to use the certificate generated in the previous section in your application when it runs from the IDE or as an executable JAR.

. Create `src/main/resources/<base-package>/keystore` directory and copy `localhost.jks` into it.

. Set the following properties in the `application.properties` file replacing `<base-package>` and `<password>` with actual values:
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
# Enables HTTPS
server.ssl.enabled=true
# The format used for the keystore
server.ssl.key-store-type = JKS
# The path to the keystore containing the certificate
server.ssl.key-store = classpath:<base-package>/keystore/localhost.jks
# The password used to generate the keystore
server.ssl.key-store-password = <password>
# The alias mapped to the certificate
server.ssl.key-alias = localhost

# Changes the server's port
server.port = 8443
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `<base-package>` in the path to the keystore (`server.ssl.key-store` property) should be presented as a slash-separated path:
----
server.ssl.key-store = classpath:com/example/demo/keystore/localhost.jks
----
====
. Open the main application class and change the `printApplicationUrl()` method. The URL should be changed to `https://` after configuring HTTPS:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@EventListener
    public void printApplicationUrl(final ApplicationStartedEvent event) {
        LoggerFactory.getLogger(DemoApplication.class).info("Application started at "
                + "https://localhost:"
                + environment.getProperty("local.server.port")
                + Strings.nullToEmpty(environment.getProperty("server.servlet.context-path")));
    }
----

[[maintenance]]
== Maintenance Tasks

The WebDAV add-on includes several maintenance tasks, as described below. To run these tasks regularly, include the Quartz add-on in your project as outlined in the xref:quartz:index.adoc#installation[Quartz / Installation] section.

[[expired-lock-cleaning-job]]
=== ExpiredLockCleaningJob

This job removes expired xref:webdav-documents.adoc#lock-unlock[lock] objects. By default, it runs every two hours.

To modify the job schedule, use the xref:webdav:webdav-properties.adoc#jmix.webdav.expired-lock-cleaning-cron[jmix.webdav.expired-lock-cleaning-cron] property.

[[webdav-document-versions-cleaning-job]]
=== WebdavDocumentVersionsCleaningJob

This job removes `WebdavDocumentVersion` instances that are not associated with any documents. By default, it runs once a month.

To change the job schedule, use the xref:webdav:webdav-properties.adoc#jmix.webdav.document-versions-cleaning-cron[jmix.webdav.document-versions-cleaning-cron] property.

[[security]]
== Configuring Security

Access restrictions for documents are set up using xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource] and xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc[row-level] roles.

[[predefined-roles]]
=== Predefined Roles

The Jmix application with the WebDAV add-on includes two default resource roles:

* *WebDAV: minimal access* - a fundamental WebDAV role necessary for all users utilizing WebDAV functionality.
* *WebDAV: view document browser* - provides permission to access the xref:webdav-documents.adoc[WebDAV documents] view.

// [[row-level-restrictions]]
// === Restricting Access to Documents
//
// Suppose that some group of users should be able to edit only the documents created by themselves. Below is an example of how to do it using row-level roles.
//
// //The following example shows how to restrict access to a particular group of users. Suppose that there is a row-level role called `Users`. It is required to configure this row-level role so that only document authors can edit documents and document versions.
//
// . Create a row-level role at runtime using UI screens available at *Administration â†’ Row-level roles.*
// . Create a row-level xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc#predicate-policy[predicate policy] for the `UPDATE` action and `WebdavDocument` entity.
// . Define a Groovy script for the created policy:
// +
// [source,groovy,indent=0]
// ----
// import io.jmix.core.security.CurrentAuthentication
//
// def authBean = applicationContext.getBean(CurrentAuthentication)
//
// return {E}.createdBy.equals(authBean.user.username)
// ----
// . Assign the role to the users.
//
// The system will check whether the current user is a document author. If it is not the case, the user will not be allowed to edit a document, and the `Access denied` message will be displayed.
//
// The *OK* button intended to save document versions will be inactive. The document itself will be opened in read-only mode.
