= Bar Chart

In this section, you will:

* Integrate a chart with multiple xref:charts:chart-component.adoc#series[series]
* Add `title`, `tooltip`, `legend` elements
* Bind data through a data container

[[multiple-series-chart]]
== Multiple Series Chart Setup

You will integrate a chart component that combines a `bar` xref:chart-component.adoc#series[series] to represent employees' salaries and a `line` series to display their total assessment scores.

[[series]]
=== Setting Chart Series

Double-click on `user-list-view.xml` in the *Jmix* tool window. First, click on the `formLayout` element where your chart will be located.

To add a `chart` element, choose *Add Component* in the actions panel, select the *Chart* item.

This will automatically add the charts namespace to your root tag, if you haven't added it in this file yet.
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<view xmlns="http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/view"
    xmlns:charts="http://jmix.io/schema/charts/ui" />
----

As well as the `<charts:chart/>` element in the `formLayout`. Configure the `id`, `height` and `width` attributes as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barChartElement]
----

To pick your charts type you need the series attribute.
Select the `chart` element in the *Jmix UI* hierarchy panel or in the view XML descriptor, then click on the *Add* button in the inspector panel. Choose *Series -> Bar* from the drop-down list.

To include the `line` series to your chart, choose the `series` element and pick *Add -> Line*. Add a name property for both chart types: `Salary` and `AssesmentTotal` respectively.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<charts:series>
    <charts:bar name="Salary"/>
    <charts:line name="Assessment Total"/>
</charts:series>
----

[[axes]]
=== Adding Axes

The `Bar`, `scatter`, `line` charts need `yAxes` and `xAxes` elements to display the chart's values.
To add an X axis, click on the charts element and choose *Add -> XAxes -> XAxis*. Your chart X axis will display the names of the employees.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=XAxes]
----

Since the chart has two different data types with varying scales, you need to configure two Y axes separately.
To configure the first Y-axis for displaying employees' salaries, click on the `chart` element and pick *Add -> XAxes -> XAxis*.

Add a `Salary` name attribute in the `XAxis` element and configure its position and alignment.

The values in the database are stored as multiples of 100,000. To display these values in a format scaled down to hundreds, add the `axisLabel` element under `YAxis` and set the formatterFunction attribute as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=YAxisSalary]
----

The `formatterFunction` attribute defines a JavaScript function which is called to adjust the format of the tick values on the axis.
In the example above, the function divides the incoming `value` by `1000` to adjust the scale from hundreds of thousands to hundreds.

To add the second Y axis, choose the `YAxes` element and pick *Add -> XAxis*, configure the axis' name, position and ticks alignment as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=YAxisTotal]
----

Next, map each Y axis with its respective series by adding `yAxisIndex` attributes in the `bar` and `line` series respectively as shown below.

[source,xml,indent=0]

[[properties]]
== Adding Chart Properties

Now, you will add optional properties to your chart such as `title`, `tooltip`, and `legend` to provide more context.

[[title]]
=== Title

By default, the `title` text appears at the top of the chart. To add a title, select the `chart` element, then choose *Add -> Title* from the inspector panel. Configure the `text` attribute to describe what the chart represents, i.e. `Salary & Assessment Total`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barTitle]
----

[[tooltip]]
=== Tooltip

The `tooltip` attribute provides detailed information when users hover over different parts of the chart. To add a `tooltip` attribute, select the `chart` element, then choose *Add -> Tooltip*. Set the trigger attribute to "AXIS" to show tooltips for all items in the same category.

include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barTooltip]
----

[[legend]]
=== Legend

The `legend` attribute helps users distinguish different categories on the chart and loads the chart's data automatically. To add a `legend` attribute, select the `chart` element, then choose *Add -> Legend*.

[source,xml,indent=0]

include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barLegend]
----

[[data-binding]]
== Data Binding Using Data Container

First, you need to load all users except the `Admin`.

Create a new xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[`collectionContainer`] under the `data` element with the `employeesDc` name and the corresponding JPQL `query` as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=dataCollection]
----

To include the loaded data to the chart, select the `chart` element and add a `dataSet` attribute manually.

[source, xml]
----
<charts:dataSet/>
----

Inside the `dataSet` element, choose the `employeesDc` container as your `source` and configure the `categoryField` as your X axis, and `valueFields` as your Y axes as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barDataSet]
----

By the end of this tutorial, your bar chart XML configuration will be as follows.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/charts-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/user/user-list-view.xml[tags=barChart]
----

This chart provides a visualization of the employeesâ€™ salaries and total assessment score.
