Jmix includes a set of xref:vc/html.adoc[HTML components] for standard HTML elements. If no suitable component is included, or you want to include native HTML directly, use the `html` component. It can render HTML provided as a string, CDATA, or file.

* XML element: `html`

* Java class: `Html`

[[basics]]
== Basics

This element is designed for embedding HTML within an XML structure. It allows embedding separate HTML elements or blocks of HTML code. The block must consist of a single root element such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, or `<div>`. Within this root element can be any number of nested `<div>` elements to structure the content effectively.

CAUTION: Note that it is the developer's responsibility to sanitize and remove any dangerous parts of the HTML before sending it to the user through this component. Passing raw input data to the user can possibly lead to cross-site scripting attacks.

=== Message Bundle

This example demonstrates how to add HTML content via a string in the xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[message bundle]:

=== Character Data

The same HTML block can be added within a CDATA (Character Data) section:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=cdata]
----

[[file-content]]
== File Content

The code for HTML block can be also obtained from a file using one of the following methods.

[[static-resource]]
=== Static Resource

The file can be served statically by the application. If your file is located
at `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/html/html-file.html`, specify it as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=static]
----

NOTE: By default, static content is served from `/static`, `/public`, `/resources`, or `/META-INF/resources` directories of the classpath. See details in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web.servlet.spring-mvc.static-content[Spring Boot documentation^].

[[stream-resource]]
=== Stream Resource

The HTML code can be supplied as a file through the `InputStream`, and then the component can be initialized by passing it in.

NOTE: The component cannot be created using the `UiComponents` bean, as it does not provide a no-arguments constructor.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/HtmlView.java[tags=stream]
----

[[css-properties]]
== CSS Properties

Use the xref:vc/common-attributes.adoc#css[css] attribute to add CSS properties declaratively:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/html/html-view.xml[tags=css-attribute]
----
//todo: link to themes section
Alternatively, you can add custom CSS styling within the application's theme.
