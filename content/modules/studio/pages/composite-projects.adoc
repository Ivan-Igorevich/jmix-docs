= Composite Projects

A composite project in Jmix refers to a project structure that organizes multiple related xref:jmix::add-ons.adoc[add-ons] and applications into a single IDE project, even if they are located in different source code repositories.

== Creating Composite Project

To create an empty composite project, start the xref:studio:project.adoc#creating-new-project[project wizard] and select the *Composite Project* template. Studio will create a project with the following structure (provided that the project name is `sales`):

----
root-dir/
    sales-all/
        build.gradle
        settings.gradle
----

Then you can add subprojects by creating new add-ons or applications, checking out an existing project from VCS or just adding an existing folder with a project. Use *New -> Subproject* actions of the Jmix Tool Window:

We recommend placing subprojects within the project's root directory, alongside the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project.

Studio shows the composite project and all subprojects as top-level nodes in the Jmix Tool Window:

As you can see, the aggregator composite project's `settings.gradle` file uses `includeBuild` instructions. These instructions leverage Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html[composite build^] feature, which helps structure projects effectively.

In a composite build, Gradle replaces dependencies on artifacts with direct dependencies between subprojects. This means that changes made to an add-on immediately impact dependent add-ons and the application. IntelliJ IDEA perfectly imports such a project, recognizing the Gradle-defined dependencies. As a result, you get a composite project structure that enables transparent refactoring and eliminates the need for the "publish locally" workflow.

== Opening Composite Project

When xref:studio:project.adoc#opening-existing-project[opening] a composite project, make sure to navigate to the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project directory and open the `build.gradle` file within that directory:

[[managing-properties]]
== Managing Properties

You can edit common properties of all subprojects. Click *Settings->Project Properties* on the toolbar of the Jmix Tool Window. Select *All subprojects* when Studio asks you which project you want to edit:

The common properties include the artifact repository settings and Jmix framework version. So, you can upgrade all subprojects to a newer Jmix version at once.

[[configuring-dependencies]]
== Configuring Dependencies

The most useful feature for large composite projects is the ability to configure dependencies between subprojects in a simple dialog.

You can open it from the *Settings -> Dependencies Between Subprojects* action of the *Jmix* Tool Window.

Here *customers* is an add-on which depends on the *users* add-on. According to changes you make in this dialog, Studio adds artifact dependencies to `build.gradle` files of the subprojects, and also configures the `@JmixModule` annotations of the add-ons. It also prevents you from introducing circular dependencies. In the screenshot below you can see that the dialog doesnâ€™t allow you to make the *users* add-on dependent on *customers* because *customers* already depends on *users*:

[[managing-data-stores]]
== Managing Data Stores

Studio can generate Liquibase changelogs in add-ons, including when working with them in composite projects.

To generate a changelog, you first need to define a xref:studio:data-stores.adoc[Data Store] in the add-on. It will be displayed in the Jmix tree:

image::studio:add-on-data-store.png[align="center",width="484"]

Its settings will be stored in the `jmix-studio.xml` file instead of the Java configuration.

Now, you can execute the *Generate Liquibase Changelog* action on the Data Store.

In a composite project, you should specify a Data Store for the same add-on again, because the composite project has its own `jmix-studio.xml` file located in the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project. So, data store settings will be stored separately for when you are working on the add-on in a standalone project and in a composite project, but the set of generated changelogs will be the same.
