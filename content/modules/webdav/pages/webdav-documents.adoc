= WebDAV Documents

After the add-on is added to your application, the main menu contains the *WebDAV* item.

The *WebDAV Documents* view allows users to view, edit, and manage documents stored on a WebDAV server.

This view displays a list of documents and supports the following operations:

* *Upload*: The *Upload* button allows you to select and upload files to the system.
* *Download*: The *Download* button enables you to download the most recent or previous versions of a document.
* *Manage Versions*: The *Manage Versions* button opens the xref:version-control.adoc#webdav-document-versions[WebDAV document versions] view.
* *Enable/Disable Versioning*: The *Enable Versioning* and *Disable Versioning* buttons control versioning for a specific document.

* *Lock*: To remove a document, you must first lock it by clicking the *Lock* button.
+
If other users attempt to save changes to this document, they will receive a warning indicating that the document is currently locked.
+
The duration for which the document remains locked can be adjusted by configuring the xref:webdav-properties.adoc#jmix.webdav.lock-timeout[jmix.webdav.lock-timeout] property.

[[collections]]
== Collections

You can create a `WebdavDocument` collection by using the *Create Collection* button on the *WebDAV Documents* view.

A `WebdavDocument` collection serves as a special type of `WebdavDocument` that functions as a container for other documents. The parent collection of a `WebdavDocument` is specified by the `parent` attribute. If this attribute is not defined for a document, the document is considered to belong to the root (top-level) collection.

By default, users are allowed to upload documents with the same names into the same collection (for example, the root collection may have two distinct documents both named `Contract1.docx`). If you wish to enforce uniqueness in document URIs, mimicking a real file system, you can set the xref:webdav-properties.adoc#jmix.webdav.auto-generate-unique-resource-uri[jmix.webdav.auto-generate-unique-resource-uri] property to `false`. In such cases, attempting to upload a document with a URI that already exists will result in a unique constraint violation.

You have the option to rename and delete collections using the *Rename* and *Remove* buttons.
