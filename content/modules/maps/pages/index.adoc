The Map add-on provides the `GeoMap` component and functionalities that enable developers to integrate interactive maps and geospatial features into their web applications.

[[overview]]
== Overview

The add-on helps you to enrich your application with visual representation and intuitive manipulation for spatial data. You can use a preferable map provider that meets your needs.

The add-on is based on the https://openlayers.org/[OpenLayers^] JavaScript library (8.1.0 version). By default, all API works with CRS - https://epsg.io/4326[EPSG:4326^].

The component integrates spatial types (point, polyline, polygon) from https://locationtech.github.io/jts/[JTS Topology Suite^] (JTS) â€” the most popular Java library for working with spatial data.

The Maps add-on supports a traditional multi-layer structure commonly used in professional GIS systems. The layers are represented as structural units of maps.
