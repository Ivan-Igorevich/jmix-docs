= Geo-objects

A geo-object, short for geospatial object, refers to an entity having a property of a geometry type. The add-on supports the following geo-specific types that comes from the JTS Topology Suite (JTS) library:

|===
| *Datatype* | *Java type*
| GeoMultiPoint         | org.locationtech.jts.geom.MultiPoint
| GeoMultiPolygone      | org.locationtech.jts.geom.MultiPolygon
| GeoMultiPolyline       | org.locationtech.jts.geom.MultiLineString
| GeoPoint         | org.locationtech.jts.geom.Point
| GeoPolygon       | org.locationtech.jts.geom.Polygon
| GeoPolyline      | org.locationtech.jts.geom.LineString
|===

To add the property, create a new attribute and select a geo-specific datatype from the list.

An example of geo-object `Location`:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/maps-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/entity/Location.java[tags=Location]
----

As you can see, `Location` is a simple entity, one of which properties building is of the `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Point` type.

To bind geo-objects to a vector layer, you need to use xref:maps:layers-sources.adoc#data-vector-source[DataVectorSource].

[[coordinates]]
== Coordinates

The `Coordinate` class in JTS encapsulates a pair of X and Y coordinates that define a point in 2D space.

Geometry objects - `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon` - are created using the given `Coordinate`.

Let's take a closer look at the examples below.

* `POINT (13.347796079315284 52.55344847222085)`
+
The first X-ordinate is longitude.
The second Y-ordinate is latitude.
* `LINESTRING (13.346886063248354 52.553529790121985, 13.347394863347068 52.5532539371346, 13.347837668453902 52.55355180648286, 13.347860653822895 52.553536712270784)`
+
A `LineString` is defined by a sequence of coordinates that delineate the vertices along the line. These coordinates are stored in a specific order to represent the continuous path of the line. The first X-ordinate in each point pair represents the longitude, while the second one represents the latitude.
