= User Interface

Jmix User Interface allows you to develop the rich web UI using Java and XML. It is based on the https://vaadin.com[Vaadin^] web framework.

In Jmix UI, your UI components work in the same JVM as your backend, which greatly simplifies working with data and invoking business logic. Also, you don't have to be familiar with the modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS stack to build the user interface from the set of predefined components.
