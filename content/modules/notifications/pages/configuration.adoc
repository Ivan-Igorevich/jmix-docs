= Configuration

After installing the add-on in your application, create notification types, configure notification channels and assign roles to users.

The add-on provides two notification channels out-of-the-box: the in-app channel shows notifications in the application UI, the email channel sends emails. You can define your own channels by creating beans implementing the `NotificationChannel` interface.

[[notification-types]]
== Notification Types

The add-on does not provide notification types by default. You should create a set of `NotificationType` instances and register them via `NotificationTypesRepository` when initializing the application. The following code can be added to any bean of the application, for example to the main application class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/notifications-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/notificationsex1/NotificationsEx1Application.java[tags=notification-type]
----
<1> Creates a notification type with the unique name info and `icon` name `INFO_CIRCLE`.

Localized messages for the notification types can be added with the following template:

----
io.jmix.notifications/NotificationType.<name>=<value>
----

In case of the example above:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/notifications-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/notificationsex1/messages_en.properties[tags=localization]
----

[[in-app-channel]]
== In-App Channel

To show notifications sent to the in-app channel, add a notification indicator component. For example, you may place it in the top right corner:

image::ntf-indicator.png[align="center" width="1268"]

For that, add `notificationIndicator` within the main view's `navigationBar` component:

[source,xml,indent=0]

----
include::example$/notifications-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/notificationsex1/view/main/main-view.xml[tags=namespace;not1;not2]
----

<1> Declares the `notifications` namespace in the root element.
<2> Adds a visual component with the unread notifications count.

[[email-channel]]
== Email Channel

To send notifications by email, add the xref:email:index.adoc[Email] add-on to the application. After that, you will be able to select the email channel in the xref:notifications:creating-notifications.adoc#ntf-editor[notification editor] window.

The recipient email address is taken from a property of the xref:security:users.adoc#entity[user] object. By default, the add-on assumes that email is stored in the `email` property. If you want to use another property, define its name in the `application.properties` file, for example:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/notifications-ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=email]
----

Besides, you can create a Spring bean implementing the `UserEmailResolver` interface to define a more complex logic of obtaining the user's email address, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/notifications-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/notificationsex1/app/GetEmailService.java[tags=service]
----

[[roles]]
== Security Roles

To work with notifications, users with limited access to the system should have one of the following roles:

* *Notifications: administrator* – a user with full access to notifications.
* *Notifications: In-app notifications reader* – a user that receives notifications sent through in-app channel and is able to read them in a special dialog.
* *Notifications: sender* – a user can create and send notifications.
* *Notifications: combines sender and reader* – combines sender and reader roles.
