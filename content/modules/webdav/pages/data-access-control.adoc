= 5. Data Access Control

In our application, we already have roles _Employees_ and _HR Managers_. In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to modify them by adding new restrictions.

[[employees-resource-role]]
== Resource Role for Employees

An employee needs to read the `WebdavDocumentWrapper` entity instances to view them in UI.

Double-click on *Security -> EmployeeRole* xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource role] in *Jmix tool* window.

Switch to the *User Interface* tab to define permissions to views. Select `WebdavDocumentWrapper.list` and `WebdavDocumentWrapper.detail` in the menu tree and select *Allow* checkboxes on the right:

After that, switch to the *Entities* tab and select the following permissions:

[[managers-resource-role]]
== Resource Role for HR Managers

HR managers need to upload documents, delete documents, and edit the content of documents.

Double-click on *Security -> HRManagerRole* xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource role] in *Jmix tool* window.

Switch to the *User Interface* tab and allow `WebdavDocumentWrapper.list`, and `WebdavDocumentWrapper.detail`.

Switch to the *Entities* tab.

Give all permissions to the `WebdavDocumentWrapper` entity.

[[webdav-document-restrictions-role]]
== Row-level WebDavDocumentsDepartmentRole

In this section, you will introduce a row-level role which restricts access to WebDAV documents for an employee.

If the employee has the role of _HR Manager_ or _Administrator_, then display all WebDAV documents.

If the employee has the role of _Employee_, display only WebDAV documents related to the employee's department.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:add.svg[]) -> *Row-level Role*. In the *New Row-level Role* dialog, enter:

* *Role name*: `WebDav documents department`
* *Role code*: `web-dav-documents-department`
* *Class*: `com.company.onboarding.security.WebDavDocumentsDepartmentRole`

Click *OK*.

Studio will create and open an annotated interface:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RowLevelRole(name = "WebDav documents department", code = WebDavDocumentsDepartmentRole.CODE)
public interface WebDavDocumentsDepartmentRole {
    String CODE = "web-dav-documents-department";
}
----

Click *Add Policy → JPQL Policy* in the top actions panel:

image::add-jpql-policy.png[align="center", width="833"]

In the *Add JPQL Policy* dialog, enter:

* *Entity*: `WebdavDocumentWrapper`
* *Where clause*: `\{E}.department = :current_user_department`

image::add-jpql-policy-2.png[align="center", width="636"]

Click *OK*.

[[assigning-roles]]
== Assigning Roles

Now let’s assign roles to users.

Launch the application and open the *Users* list view. Select the user `alice` and click the *Role assignments* button:

image::role-assign-1.png[align="center", width="1451"]

In the *Role assignments* view, click the *Add* button in the *Resource roles* panel.

In the *Select resource roles* dialog, select `WebDAV: minimal access` role. Click *Select*.

TIP: The `WebDAV: minimal access` role is required for all users who require WebDAV functionality. It grants basic access to all WebDAV-related entities within the system.

Ensure that the user `alice` has the following resource and row-level roles:

image::role-assign-2.png[align="center", width="1451"]

Add `WebDAV: minimal access` resource role for the user `bob`.

Click the *Add* button in the *Row-level roles* panel.

In the *Select row-level roles* dialog, select `web-dav-documents-department` role. Click *Select*.

Ensure that the user `bob` has the following resource and row-level roles:

image::role-assign-3.png[align="center", width="1451"]

Log in as `alice`.

`alice` is HR Manager. So this user can view all WebDAV documents uploaded to the system, upload new documents, delete documents, and edit the content of documents.

Ensure this by accessing the *Knowledge base* view.

image::view-by-alice.png[align="center", width="1432"]

Log in as `bob`.

`bob` is Employee. So this user can view only WebDAV documents related to the employee's department. Such a user can only download Web DAV documents using the *Download* button, but cannot create or delete them.

Ensure this by accessing the *Knowledge base* view.

image::view-by-bob.png[align="center", width="1432"]

As you can see, the *Create* and *Remove* buttons are unavailable for this user.

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have modified HR Managers and Employees roles to restrict access to the application for different groups of users.

You have learned that:

* A xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[resource role] grants users the ability to access views and interact with specific entities.
* A xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc[row-level role], in contrast, is used to restrict a user's ability to read specific rows of data.
* Roles are assigned to users at runtime using the *Role assignment* view available from the `User.detail` view.
* The `WebDAV: minimal access` role is required for all users who require WebDAV functionality.
