= View Designer
:page-aliases: screen-designer.adoc

View Designer represents a number of panels and tool windows that allow you to develop the view layout and set UI components properties in WYSIWYG style. The view XML editor is integrated with the View Designer, so you can edit the XML file directly or use the designer's panels to generate code.

include::subscription-note.adoc[]

The *Jmix UI* panel is implemented as independent IDE tool windows and displayed for both view XML descriptors and controllers. It allows you to see the components tree, change component properties or even add new components to the view while working with Java code in the controller. You can also inject components to the controller by dragging and dropping them from the structure to the code editor.

[[layout-preview-panel]]
== Layout Preview Panel

The Layout Preview panel is used to display an interactive schematic presentation of the view layout. It shares editor space with the source code of the view descriptor.

The *Preview* panel requires building the frontend and starting Vaadin Development Mode Server, which can take a long time.

The *Preview* panel is opened when you click the *Start Preview* button in the top panel of the XML editor. After that, the preview will be active for all subsequently opened views of the project.

image::screen-views.png[align="center",width="905"]

Use the buttons in the top right corner of the view layout editor.

. *Editor only* - only source code is displayed in the editor.
. *Editor and Preview* - editor space is split to contain both source code and preview.
. *Preview only* - only preview is displayed in the editor.
. *Preview in Window* - source code is displayed in the editor while preview is displayed in the separate window.

The panel has several controls located in the top right corner:

* The *Restart -> Just Restart* button reloads the content of the preview page.
* The *Restart -> Clean and Restart* button cleans all the frontend files and starts the frontend development build.
* The *Console* button opens or closes the console showing the frontend build output, which can be helpful in diagnosing problems.
* The *Theme* dropdown allows you to select one of the predefined themes: light or dark.
* To deactivate the preview, click *Stop Preview*.

[[component-palette]]
== Component Palette

You can open the component palette using the following methods:

* Click *Add Component* in the top actions panel:
+
image::add-component-method1.png[align="center",width="531"]

* Right-click *Add Component* in the Jmix UI structure context menu:
+
image::add-component-method2.png[align="center",width="410"]

* Using `⌘N` on MacOS or `Alt+Insert` on Windows and Linux, open the *Generate* menu:
+
image::add-component-method3.png[align="center",width="494"]

The *Add Component* action has two tabs:

* *From Palette* tab displays the component palette, which shows a set of available view elements: xref:flow-ui:vc/components.adoc[components], xref:flow-ui:vc/layouts.adoc[layouts], xref:flow-ui:vc/html.adoc[HTML components], xref:flow-ui:data-components.adoc[data components] - containers and loaders, xref:flow-ui:facets.adoc[facets] that include actions and dialog mode settings.
+
image::view-palette.png[align="center",width="511"]
+
Use the search box to find the component you need.
+
In order to add a component to the layout, drag it from the palette to the appropriate place in the XML source code or into the <<component-hierarchy,Jmix UI structure>> panel.
+
Right-click the component in the palette to open the context menu with the following actions:
+
** *Add to Design* - adds the selected component to the view inside the selected element in the structure.
** *Jmix Documentation* - opens the component’s documentation page.
* *Using Wizard* tab provides wizards that help solving complex UI-related tasks. For example, the *Edit entity attributes* wizard creates a `formLayout` with fields for selected entity attributes and a data container with a proper fetch plan.
The list of wizards is sensitive to the current view contents: for example, if the view already contains a `dataGrid`, the *Add column to DataGrid* wizard is available.

[[component-hierarchy]]
== Jmix UI Structure

The *Jmix UI* structure panel displays a tree of the components added to the layout.

You can move elements from the component palette or rearrange the elements in the tree. When the element is selected, the *Jmix UI* inspector panel displays its properties.

Right-click the element to open its context menu with the following actions:

image::components-hierarchy.png[align="center",width="410"]

* *Add Component* opens the <<component-palette,component palette>>.
* *Inject to Controller* injects the component to the view controller or navigate to the existing injection declaration.
//* *Generate Handler* is used to generate the handler method of the component.
* *Go to XML* navigates to the XML tag in the source code.
* *Wrap into* is used to wrap the component into one of the suggested layouts.
* *Convert to* is used to convert the component to one of similar alternative components.
* *Delete*, *Copy*, *Cut* or *Paste* are used to perform the appropriate actions with the component.
* *Jmix Documentation* opens the documentation page for the selected component.

[[component-inspector]]
== Jmix UI Inspector

The *Jmix UI* inspector panel displays the *Properties* and *Handlers* tabs.

[[component-inspector-add-button]]
For some types of selected elements, the *+ Add* button is shown that allows you to add the related sub-element, such as data grid action, column, formatter, validator, and so on.
