= Get Started with Maps
:page-aliases: maps:quick-start.adoc

This guide shows how to start using maps in your application.

We will use the Onboarding application as a basis.

If you did not create this application, go to the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section, which contains a step-by-step description for developing the application.

Otherwise, download the complete application source code from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository. Then open it in Jmix Studio as described in the xref:studio:project.adoc#opening-existing-project[Opening Existing Project] section.

Add the Maps add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

Letâ€™s look at the model of the sample onboarding application.

We will add a new entity - `Location`. Two types of locations are presented in the application: office and coworking space. When creating a user card, HR manager selects the base location - the office where the user was assigned to work.

* The user should be able to see all available locations marked with markers on the map.
* Offices and coworking spaces should be marked with different markers.
* The user should be able to change the base location by clicking on the map marker.

== Creating Entity and Screens

1. Create `Order` entity containing the following fields:

* `date` with `Date` type.
* `product` with `String` type.
* `amount` with `Integer` type.

2. Create `OrderBrowse` and `OrderEdit` screens.

== Adding Maps on Screens

To display a map on the screen, you need to add `geoMap` UI component in the XML descriptor.

First, declare the `maps` namespace in the root element of the `order-edit.xml` descriptor by adding `xmlns:maps="http://jmix.io/schema/maps/ui"` schema:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/order/order-edit.xml[tags=schema]
----

Next, declare the `geoMap` component:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/order/order-edit.xml[tags=order-edit1;order-edit2]
----

* `height` and `width` specify the size of the map window. Can be set in pixels or per sents.
* `centerX` defines longitude of the initial geographical center of the map.
* `centerY` defines latitude of the initial geographical center of the map.
* `zoom` defines the initial zoom level. The default value is 15.

Do the same in the `order-browse.xml` file.

Use `hbox` and `vbox` elements to set the map position on the screen. Here is an example of *Order browser* screen:

== Adding Raster Layer

We will use a raster layer as a base background layer of a map. Let's use OpenStreetMap tile provider which comes out of the box, so you can use it like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/order/order-browse.xml[tags=raster;raster-end]
----

Add the code above in the edit and browse screens. Here is how the *Order Edit* screen looks:

== Creating Geo-Object

To make a geo-object from the entity, add an attribute to it with one of geo-specific datatypes. We want to place orders on the map, so let's add the attribute of `GeoPoint` datatype.

Open entity designer and create a new attribute `location`. Select `GeoPoint` datatype from the list.

When you added the attribute, open the code of the entity, and add the `@Geometry` annotation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/entity/Order.java[tags=entity-begin;geo-object;entity-end]
----

== Adding Vector Layers

To display geo-objects on the map, you need to add a vector layer. 

Lets's start with *Order Browser* screen, declare a vector layer in the XML descriptor and pass a `dataContainer` to the layer:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/order/order-browse.xml[tags=vector]
----

Then, add the following code under the layers tag into *Order Edit* XML descriptor. 

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/maps/ex1/screen/order/order-edit.xml[tags=layers]
----

<1> The layer should be selected on the map so that it can fires events, reacts on user clicks and can be modified by UI interaction.
<2> The layer is editable, so you can modify the geometry of geo-objects.

== Adding Tooltip

To display a product next to orders on the map on mouseover, we will use the `tooltipContentProvider`.

Let's perform it declaratively using the `@Install` annotation in the screen controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/maps/ex1/screen/order/OrderBrowse.java[tags=tooltip]
----

== Maps in the Application

Now, we are ready to run the application. Go to the *Order browser* screen and click *Create*. Let's add a few orders. To point the location of the order, just click on the map.

Go back to the *Order browser* screen. To view the product of the order, move the cursor on the order.
