= View Creation Wizard
:page-aliases: screen-wizard.adoc

The wizard generates basic code for your view, including necessary components and configuration, saving you time and effort. It offers templates for various view types, including:

* Entity-based views: for displaying and editing data related to a specific xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity].
* DTO-based views: for displaying and editing data from xref:data-model:entities.adoc#dto[DTO].
* Other view types: the wizard can generate blank views not associated with an entity; xref:flow-ui:fragments/fragments.adoc[fragments]; main view with xref:flow-ui:vc/components/horizontalMenu.adoc[top menu]; and more.

== Creating Entity-based Views

If you want to create CRUD views for an entity, you can select the entity in the tree and right-click *New -> View*.

Another way is to click *Views -> Create View* on the xref:studio:entity-designer.adoc#actions-panel[actions panel] of the Entity Designer.

On the *Create Jmix View* page of wizard, choose the appropriate template from the list provided by the Studio.

On the next step, you can modify the automatically generated view properties.

[NOTE]
====
Select the *Use Data Repositories* checkbox in the *Advanced* section, and choose an existing xref:studio:data-repository-wizard.adoc[data repository] from the dropdown. The wizard will generate the load and save delegates that invoke appropriate repository methods.
====

On the *Entity list and detail options* step, you can configure how your views display and interact with data from an entity.

For example, you can set up data grid xref:flow-ui:actions/list-actions.adoc[actions], which will be displayed on the list view. DataGrid configurations like xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#selectionMode[multi-select], column xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#columnReorderingAllowed[reordering], column xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc#resizable[resizing] are also enabled.

Click *Next*.

At the *Entity list view fetch plan* and *Entity detail view fetch plan* steps, you can select the amount of data that will be displayed in the views. You can use one of the xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#built-in-fetch-plans[built-in] fetch plans or create your own with the help of xref:studio:fetch-plan-designer.adoc[Fetch Plan Designer] or xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#creating-fetch-plans[programmatically].

Click *Next*.

The final step of the wizard allows you to set titles for the views.

After clicking the *Create* button, the view XML descriptor and view controller will be generated. The xref:localization:message-bundles.adoc[Message Bundle] file will be updated. In case of creating a list view, a new menu item will be added to the main menu.

Use xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View designer] to set up your views.
