= 5. Working with Data in UI

At this stage of development, the application has the Steps and Departments management and the default User management with the added `Onboarding status` attribute. Now you need to link Users with Steps and Departments.

In this chapter, you will do the following:

* Add `department` and `joiningDate` attributes to the `User` entity and show them in UI.
* Create the `UserStep` entity which links a user with an onboarding step.
* Add a collection of `UserStep` entities to the `User` entity and show it on the `User.edit` screen.
* Implement the generation and saving of `UserStep` instances in the `User.detail` view.

The diagram below shows the entities and attributes addressed in this chapter:

image::data-in-ui/data-in-ui-diagram.svg[align="center"]

[[ref-attr]]
== Adding Reference Attribute

You've already done a similar task when created the xref:references.adoc#create-reference-attr[HR Manager attribute] of the `Department` entity as a reference to `User`. Now you need to create a link in the opposite direction: a User should have a reference to Department.

image::data-in-ui/data-in-ui-diagram-2.svg[align="center"]

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Double-click on the `User` entity in *Jmix* tool window and select its last attribute (to add the new attribute to the end).

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar.

In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `department` into the *Name* field. Then select:

* *Attribute type*: `ASSOCIATION`
* *Type*: `Department`
* *Cardinality*: *Many to One*

image::data-in-ui/add-attr-1.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

Select the new `department` attribute and click the *Add to Views* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar:

image::data-in-ui/add-attr-2.png[align="center", width="490"]

The appeared dialog window will show `User.detail` and `User.list` views. Select both screens and click *OK*.

Studio will add the `department` attribute to the `dataGrid` component of the `User.list` view and to the `formLayout` component of the `User.detail` view.

You may also notice the following code added by Studio automatically to `user-list-view.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<data>
    <collection id="usersDc"
                class="com.company.onboarding.entity.User">
        <fetchPlan extends="_base">
            <property name="department" fetchPlan="_base"/> <!-- added -->
        </fetchPlan>
----

And to `user-detail-view.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<data>
    <instance id="userDc"
              class="com.company.onboarding.entity.User">
        <fetchPlan extends="_base">
            <property name="department" fetchPlan="_base"/> <!-- added -->
        </fetchPlan>
----

With this code, the referenced Department will be loaded together with the User in the same database query.

TIP: The views would work without including `department` in the fetch plans due to the _lazy loading_ of references. But in this case, the references would be loaded by separate requests to the database. Lazy loading can affect performance of the list view, because then it loads a list of Users with a first request, and after that, executes separate requests for loading a Department of each User in the list (N+1 query problem).

Let's run the application and see the new attribute in action.

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog for adding the `DEPARTMENT_ID` column to the `USER_` table, creating a foreign key constraint and an index. Confirm the changelog.

Studio will execute the changelog and start the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the *Users* item in the *Application* menu. You will see the *Department* column in the `User.list` view and *Department* picker field in `User.detail`:

image::data-in-ui/add-attr-3.png[align="center", width="869"]

[[using-dropdown]]
== Using Dropdown for Selecting Reference

By default, Studio generates the `entityPicker` component for selecting references. You can see it in the `User.detail` view. Open `user-detail-view.xml` and find the `entityPicker` component inside the `formLayout`:

[source,xml]
----
<layout ...>
    <formLayout id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
        ...
        <entityPicker id="departmentField" property="department">
            <actions>
                <action id="entityLookup" type="entity_lookup"/>
                <action id="entityClear" type="entity_clear"/>
            </actions>
        </entityPicker>
    </formLayout>
----

This component allows you to select a related entity from a list view with filtering, sorting, and paging. But when the expected number of records is relatively small (say, less than 1000), it's more convenient to select references from a simple dropdown list.

Let's change the `User.detail` view and use the `entityComboBox` component for selecting a Department.

Change the XML element of the component to `entityComboBox` and remove the nested `actions` element:

[source,xml]
----
<entityComboBox id="departmentField" property="department"/>
----

Switch to the running application and reopen the User detail view.

You will see that the *Department* field is now a dropdown, but it cannot be opened, even if you have created some Departments:

image::data-in-ui/dropdown-2.png[align="center", width="430"]

[[options-container]]
=== Creating Items Data Container

Let's provide a list of items to the `entityComboBox` component displaying the reference to Department. The list should contain all Departments ordered by name.

Click *Add Component* in the actions panel, select the `Data components` section, and double-click the `Collection` item. In the *Data Container Properties Editor* window, select `Department` in the *Entity* field and click *OK*:

image::data-in-ui/options-container-1.gif[align="center"]

The new `collection` element with `departmentsDc` id will be created under the `data` element in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<data>
    ...
    <collection id="departmentsDc" class="com.company.onboarding.entity.Department">
        <fetchPlan extends="_base"/>
        <loader id="departmentsDl" readOnly="true">
            <query>
                <![CDATA[select e from Department e]]>
            </query>
        </loader>
    </collection>
</data>
----

This element defines a _collection data container_ and a _loader_ for it. The data container will contain a list of Department entities loaded by the loader with the specified query.

You can edit the query right in the XML or with JPQL Query Designer. To start the designer, find the link next to the `query` attribute in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel and click it:

image::data-in-ui/options-container-2.png[align="center",width="365"]

In the *JPQL Query Designer* window, switch to the *ORDER* tab and add the `name` attribute to the list:

image::data-in-ui/options-container-3.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

The resulting query in XML will look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<data>
    ...
    <collection id="departmentsDc" class="com.company.onboarding.entity.Department">
        <fetchPlan extends="_base"/>
        <loader id="departmentsDl" readOnly="true">
            <query>
                <![CDATA[select e from Department e
                order by e.name asc]]>
            </query>
        </loader>
    </collection>
</data>
----

Now you need to link the `entityComboBox` component with the `departmentsDc` collection container.

Select `departmentField` in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and select `departmentsDc` for the `itemsContainer` attribute in the inspector panel:

image::data-in-ui/options-container-4.png[align="center",width="364"]

Switch to the running application and reopen the User editor screen.

You will see that the *Department* dropdown now has a list of options:

image::data-in-ui/dropdown-3.png[align="center", width="438"]

TIP: The `entityComboBox` component allows you to filter options by entering text into the field. But keep in mind that filtering is performed in the server memory, all options are loaded from the database at once.

[[user-step-entity]]
== Creating UserStep Entity

In this section, you will create the `UserStep` entity which represents onboarding Steps for a particular User:

image::data-in-ui/data-in-ui-diagram-3.svg[align="center"]

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:common/add.svg[]) -> *JPA Entity* and create `UserStep` entity with *Versioned* trait as you did xref:references.adoc#create-entity[before].

Add the following attributes to the new entity:

|===
|Name |Attribute type |Type |Cardinality  |Mandatory

|user
|ASSOCIATION
|User
|Many to One
|true

|step
|ASSOCIATION
|Step
|Many to One
|true

|dueDate
|DATATYPE
|LocalDate
|-
|true

|completedDate
|DATATYPE
|LocalDate
|-
|false

|sortValue
|DATATYPE
|Integer
|-
|true

|===

The final state of the entity designer should look as below:

image::data-in-ui/create-user-step-1.png[align="center"]

[[composition-attr]]
== Adding Composition Attribute

Consider the relationship between `User` and `UserStep` entities. `UserStep` instances exist only in the context of a particular `User` instance (owned by it). A `UserStep` instance cannot change its owner - it just doesn't make any sense. Also, there are no links to `UserStep` from other data model objects, they are completely encapsulated in a User context.

In Jmix, such a relationship is called _composition_: the User is composed of a collection of UserSteps, among other attributes.

TIP: Composition in Jmix implements the Aggregate pattern of Domain-Driven Design.

It's often convenient to create an attribute that contains the collection of composition items in the owning entity.

Let's create the `steps` attribute in the `User` entity:

image::data-in-ui/data-in-ui-diagram-4.svg[align="center"]

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Open the `User` entity designer and click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `steps` into the *Name* field. Then select:

* *Attribute type*: `COMPOSITION`
* *Type*: `UserStep`
* *Cardinality*: *One to Many*

image::data-in-ui/composition-1.png[align="center"]

Notice that `user` is selected automatically in the *Mapped by* field. It's the attribute of the `UserStep` entity mapped to a database column which maintains the relationship between UserSteps and Users (the foreign key).

Click *OK*.

The attribute source code will have the `@Composition` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Composition
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
private List<UserStep> steps;
----

UserSteps should be displayed in the User edit screen, so select the new `steps` attribute and click the *Add to Views* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar. Select `User.detail` view and click *OK*.

Studio will modify `user-detail-view.xml` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<data>
    <instance id="userDc"
              class="com.company.onboarding.entity.User">
        <fetchPlan extends="_base">
            <property name="department" fetchPlan="_base"/>
            <property name="steps" fetchPlan="_base"/> <!--1-->
        </fetchPlan>
        <loader/>
        <collection id="stepsDc" property="steps"/> <!--2-->
    </instance>
    ...
<layout ...>
    <formLayout id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
        ...
    </formLayout>
    <hbox id="buttonsPanel" classNames="buttons-panel">
        <button action="stepsDataGrid.create"/>
        <button action="stepsDataGrid.edit"/>
        <button action="stepsDataGrid.remove"/>
    </hbox>
    <dataGrid id="stepsDataGrid" dataContainer="stepsDc" ...> <!--3-->
        <actions>
            <action id="create" type="list_create"/>
            <action id="edit" type="list_edit"/>
            <action id="remove" type="list_remove"/>
        </actions>
        <columns>
            <column property="version"/>
            <column property="dueDate"/>
            <column property="completedDate"/>
            <column property="sortValue"/>
        </columns>
    </dataGrid>
----
<1> Attribute `steps` of the fetch plan ensures the collection of UserSteps is loaded eagerly together with User.
<2> The nested `stepsDc` collection data container enables binding of visual components to the `steps` collection attribute.
<3> The `dataGrid` component displays data from the linked `stepsDc` collection container.

Let’s run the application and see these changes in action.

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog for creating the `USER_STEP` table, foreign key constraints, and indexes for references to `USER_` and `STEP`. Confirm the changelog.

Studio will execute the changelog and start the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Open a user for editing. You will see the data grid displaying the `UserStep` entity:

image::data-in-ui/composition-2.png[align="center"]

If you click *Create* in the data grid, you will get an exception saying that `View 'UserStep.detail' is not defined`. This is true - you didn't create a detail view for the `UserStep` entity. But it's not actually needed in our application, because `UserStep` instances should be generated from the predefined `Step` instances for the particular `User`.

[[generate-user-steps]]
== Generating UserSteps for User

In this section, you will implement the generation and showing of `UserStep` instances for the edited `User`.

[[joining-date-attr]]
=== Adding JoiningDate Attribute

First, let's add the `joiningDate` attribute to the `User` entity:

image::data-in-ui/data-in-ui-diagram-5.svg[align="center"]

It will be used to calculate the `dueDate` attribute of the generated `UserStep` entity: `UserStep.dueDate = User.joiningDate + Step.duration`.

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar of the `User` entity designer. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `joiningDate` into the *Name* field and select `LocalDate` in the *Type* field:

image::data-in-ui/joining-date-1.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

Select the newly created `joiningDate` attribute and click the *Add to Views* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar. Select both `User.detail` and `User.list` views in the appeared dialog and click *OK*.

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog for adding the `JOINING_DATE` column to the `USER_` table. Confirm the changelog.

Studio will execute the changelog and start the application. Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser, log in to the application and check that the new attribute is shown in the User list and detail views.

[[custom-button]]
=== Adding Custom Button

Now you need to remove the standard actions and buttons for managing UserSteps and add a button for starting a custom logic of creating entities.

Open `user-detail-view.xml` and remove all `button` elements from `hbox` and the entire `actions` element from `dataGrid`:

[source,xml]
----
<hbox id="buttonsPanel" classNames="buttons-panel">
</hbox>
<dataGrid id="stepsDataGrid" dataContainer="stepsDc" width="100%" height="100%">
    <columns>
        <column property="version"/>
        <column property="dueDate"/>
        <column property="completedDate"/>
        <column property="sortValue"/>
    </columns>
</dataGrid>
----

Then select `buttonsPanel` in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click *Add Component* in the context menu of the node. Find `Components -> Button` in the palette and double-click it. Set the `id` of the created `button` element to `generateButton` and `text` to `Generate` in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel. After that, switch to the *Handlers* tab and create a `ClickEvent` handler method:

image::data-in-ui/button-1.gif[]

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and check that the *Generate* button is shown instead of the standard CRUD buttons:

image:data-in-ui/button-2.png[align="center"]

[[create-user-steps]]
=== Creating and Saving UserStep Instances

Let's implement the logic of generating `UserStep` instances.

Add the following fields to the `UserDetailView` controller:

[source,java]
----
public class UserDetailView extends StandardDetailView<User> {

    @Autowired
    private DataManager dataManager;

    @Autowired
    private Notifications notifications;

    @ViewComponent
    private DataContext dataContext;

    @ViewComponent
    private CollectionPropertyContainer<UserStep> stepsDc;
----

[TIP]
====
If you copy the fields above and paste them to the source code, IDE will highlight them as errors because you also need to add `import` statements for the classes. Place the cursor on each error and the IDE will suggest you an appropriate import. If it doesn't, close the editor tab, then open `UserDetailView.java` again.
====

[TIP]
====
You can inject view components and Spring beans using the *Inject* button in the actions panel:

image::data-in-ui/inject-1.gif[]
====

Add the logic of creating and saving `UserStep` objects to the `generateButton` click handler method:

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe("generateButton")
public void onGenerateButtonClick(final ClickEvent<Button> event) {
    User user = getEditedEntity(); // <1>

    if (user.getJoiningDate() == null) { // <2>
        notifications.create("Cannot generate steps for user without 'Joining date'")
                .show();
        return;
    }

    List<Step> steps = dataManager.load(Step.class)
            .query("select s from Step s order by s.sortValue asc")
            .list(); // <3>

    for (Step step : steps) {
        if (stepsDc.getItems().stream().noneMatch(userStep ->
                userStep.getStep().equals(step))) { // <4>
            UserStep userStep = dataContext.create(UserStep.class); // <5>
            userStep.setUser(user);
            userStep.setStep(step);
            userStep.setDueDate(user.getJoiningDate().plusDays(step.getDuration()));
            userStep.setSortValue(step.getSortValue());
            stepsDc.getMutableItems().add(userStep); // <6>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Use `getEditedEntity()` method of the base `StandardDetailView` class to get the `User` being edited.
<2> If `joiningDate` attribute is not set, show a message and quit.
<3> Load the list of registered Steps.
<4> Skip the Step if it's already in the `stepsDc` collection container.
<5> Create new `UserStep` instance using `DataContext.create()` method.
<6> Add the new `UserStep` instance to the `stepsDc` collection container to show it in the UI.

NOTE: When you create an entity instance through the `DataContext` object, the instance becomes managed by `DataContext` and is saved automatically when the view is saved, that is, when you click *OK* button of the view.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and check that when you click the *Generate* button, a few records corresponding to the onboarding Steps are created.

If you save the view by clicking *OK*, all created UserSteps will be saved. If you click *Cancel*, nothing will be saved to the database. It happens because in the code above, you don't save the created `UserStep` objects directly to the database. Instead, you merge them into the view's `DataContext` by creating them through `DataContext.create()`. So the new instances are saved only when the entire `DataContext` is saved.

[[improve-data-grid]]
== Improving UserSteps Data Grid

In the sections below, you will finalize the UI for working with generated UserSteps.

[[order-nested-collection]]
=== Ordering Nested Collection

You may notice that when you open a User with previously generated UserSteps, they are not ordered according to the `sortValue` attribute:

image::data-in-ui/ordering-1.png[align="center"]

The data grid displays the `steps` collection attribute of the `User` entity, so you can introduce ordering on the data model level.

Open the `User` entity, select `steps` attribute and enter `sortValue` to the *Order by* field:

image::data-in-ui/ordering-2.png[align="center"]

If you switch to the *Text* tab, you can see the `@OrderBy` annotation on the `steps` attribute:

[source,java]
----
@OrderBy("sortValue")
@Composition
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
private List<UserStep> steps;
----

Now when you load the `User` entity, its `steps` collection will be sorted by the `UserStep.sortValue` attribute.

If your application is running, restart it.

Open the User detail view. Now the ordering of UserSteps is correct:

image::data-in-ui/ordering-3.png[align="center"]

[[rearrange-data-grid-columns]]
=== Rearranging Data Grid Columns

Currently, the UserSteps data grid is not very informative. Let's remove the `Version` and `Sort value` columns and add a column showing the Step name.

Removing a column is straightforward: just select it in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and press *Delete*, or remove the element directly from XML.

To add a column, select the `columns` element in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click *Add* -> *Column* in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel. The *Add Column* dialog appears:

image::data-in-ui/columns-2.png[align="center"]

As you can see, it doesn't allow you to add a Step name. This is because the `step` attribute is a reference, and you didn't define a proper fetch plan to load it.

Select the `userDc` data container in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click the *Edit* button (image:common/edit.svg[]) either in the `fetchPlan` property in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel or in the gutter of the XML editor:

image::data-in-ui/columns-3.png[align="center",width="1151"]

In the *Edit Fetch Plan* window, select `steps` -> `step` attribute and click *OK*:

image::data-in-ui/columns-4.png[align="center"]

The nested attribute will be added to fetch plan XML:

[source,xml]
----
<instance id="userDc"
          class="com.company.onboarding.entity.User">
    <fetchPlan extends="_base">
        <property fetchPlan="_base" name="department"/>
        <property fetchPlan="_base" name="steps">
            <property name="step" fetchPlan="_base"/>
        </property>
    </fetchPlan>
    <loader/>
    <collection id="stepsDc" property="steps"/>
</instance>
----

Now the collection of UserSteps will be eagerly loaded from the database together with the related `Step` instances.

Select the `columns` element in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click *Add* -> *Column* in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel. The *Add Column* dialog now contains the related `Step` entity and its attributes:

image::data-in-ui/columns-5.png[align="center", width="386"]

Select `step` -> `name` and click *OK*. The new column will be added to the end of the columns list:

[source,xml]
----
<dataGrid id="stepsDataGrid" dataContainer="stepsDc" ...>
    <columns>
        <column property="dueDate"/>
        <column property="completedDate"/>
        <column property="step.name"/>
    </columns>
----

Instead of `step.name` you could use just `step`. In this case, the column would display the xref:references.adoc#instance-name[instance name] of the entity. For `Step`, the instance name is obtained from the `name` attribute, so the result would be the same.

TIP: You could also add the `step` column without modifying the fetch plan, and the UI would still work due to lazy loading of references. But then `Step` instances would be loaded by separate requests for each `UserStep` in the collection (N+1 query problem).

Move the `step.name` column to the beginning by dragging and dropping the element in the *Jmix UI* structure panel or editing the XML directly:

[source,xml]
----
<dataGrid id="stepsDataGrid" dataContainer="stepsDc" width="100%" height="100%">
    <columns>
        <column property="step.name"/>
        <column property="dueDate"/>
        <column property="completedDate"/>
    </columns>
</dataGrid>
----

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and check that the data grid now shows the Step name:

image::data-in-ui/columns-6.png[align="center"]

[[component-column]]
=== Adding Component Column

In this section, you will implement an ability to mark a UserStep completed by clicking a checkbox in the data grid row. The checkbox will be rendered in the additional column on the left side of the data grid.

Add a new column to `stepsDataGrid`:

[source,xml]
----
<dataGrid id="stepsDataGrid" ...>
    <columns>
        <column key="completed" sortable="false" width="4em" flexGrow="0"/>
----

This column is not bound to an entity attribute, so it has the `key` attribute instead of `property`.

Select the `completed` column, switch to the *Handlers* tab of the component inspector and create the `renderer` handler method:

[source,java]
----
@Supply(to = "stepsDataGrid.completed", subject = "renderer")
private Renderer<UserStep> stepsDataGridCompletedRenderer() {
    return null;
}
----

Inject `UiComponents` object into controller class:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private UiComponents uiComponents;
----

TIP: You can use *Inject* button in the top actions panel of the editor to inject dependencies into view controllers and Spring beans.

Implement the `stepsDataGridCompletedRenderer` method:

[source,java]
----
@Supply(to = "stepsDataGrid.completed", subject = "renderer")
private Renderer<UserStep> stepsDataGridCompletedRenderer() {
    return new ComponentRenderer<>(userStep -> { // <1>
        Checkbox checkbox = uiComponents.create(Checkbox.class); // <2>
        checkbox.setValue(userStep.getCompletedDate() != null);
        checkbox.addValueChangeListener(e -> { // <3>
            if (userStep.getCompletedDate() == null) {
                userStep.setCompletedDate(LocalDate.now());
            } else {
                userStep.setCompletedDate(null);
            }
        });
        return checkbox; // <4>
    });
}
----
<1> The method returns a `Renderer` object that creates a UI component to be rendered in the column. The renderer receives an entity instance for the current row.
<2> The `Checkbox` component instance is created using the `UiComponents` factory.
<3> When you click the checkbox, its value changes and the checkbox calls its `ValueChangeEvent` listener. The listener sets the `completedDate` attribute of the `UserStep` entity.
<4> The renderer returns the visual component to be shown in the column cells.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and click checkboxes for some rows. The *Completed date* column will change accordingly:

The changes in `UserStep` instances will be saved to the database when you click *OK* in the view. It's the responsibility of the screen's `DataContext`: it tracks changes in all entities and saves to the database changed instances.

[[reacting-to-changes]]
=== Reacting to Changes

When you generate steps for the user, mark a UserStep completed or remove a step, the `Onboarding status` field should change accordingly.

Let's implement reaction to the UserSteps collection changes.

Open `UserDetailView` controller and click *Generate Handler* in the top actions panel. Collapse all items, then select `ItemPropertyChangeEvent` and `CollectionChangeEvent` items in `Data containers handlers` -> `stepsDc`:

Click *OK*.

Studio will generate two method stubs: `onStepsDcItemPropertyChange()` and `onStepsDcCollectionChange()`. Implement them as below:

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe(id = "stepsDc", target = Target.DATA_CONTAINER)
public void onStepsDcCollectionChange(final CollectionContainer.CollectionChangeEvent<UserStep> event) {
    updateOnboardingStatus(); // <1>
}

@Subscribe(id = "stepsDc", target = Target.DATA_CONTAINER)
public void onStepsDcItemPropertyChange(final InstanceContainer.ItemPropertyChangeEvent<UserStep> event) {
    updateOnboardingStatus(); // <2>
}

private void updateOnboardingStatus() {
    User user = getEditedEntity(); // <3>

    long completedCount = user.getSteps() == null ? 0 :
            user.getSteps().stream()
                    .filter(us -> us.getCompletedDate() != null)
                    .count();
    if (completedCount == 0) {
        user.setOnboardingStatus(OnboardingStatus.NOT_STARTED); // <4>
    } else if (completedCount == user.getSteps().size()) {
        user.setOnboardingStatus(OnboardingStatus.COMPLETED);
    } else {
        user.setOnboardingStatus(OnboardingStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
    }
}
----
<1> `ItemPropertyChangeEvent` handler is invoked when an attribute of the entity changes.
<2> `CollectionChangeEvent` handler is invoked when items are added to or removed from the container.
<3> Get the currently edited `User` instance.
<4> Update `onboardingStatus` attribute. Thanks to the data binding, the changed value will be immediately shown by the UI component.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Refresh the User detail view and make some changes in the UserStep table. Watch the `Onboarding status` field value.

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have implemented two features:

. Ability to specify a department for a user.
. Generation and management of onboarding steps for a user.

You have learned that:

* Reference attributes should be added to a screen's xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#fetch-plan[fetch plan] to avoid the N+1 query problem.

* The xref:flow-ui:vc/components/entityComboBox.adoc[] component can be used to select a related entity from a dropdown. This component requires a xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[] with options to be set in the `itemsContainer` property.

* The relationship between `User` and `UserStep` entities is an example of _composition_, when instances of the related entity (`UserStep`) can exist only as a part of its owner (`User`). Such a reference is marked with xref:data-model:entities.adoc#composition[@Composition] annotation.

* A collection of related entities can be ordered using the `@OrderBy` annotation on the reference attribute.

* The `ClickEvent` handler of the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc[] component is used to handle button clicks. It can be generated on the *Handlers* tab of the *Jmix UI* inspector panel.

* The `getEditedEntity()` method of the entity detail view returns the entity instance being edited.

* The xref:flow-ui:notifications.adoc[Notifications] interface is used to show popup notifications.

* The xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager] interface can be used to load data from the database.

* A nested collection of related entities is loaded into a xref:flow-ui:data/property-containers.adoc[CollectionPropertyContainer]. Its `getItems()` and `getMutableItems()` methods can be used to iterate over and to add/remove items to the collection.

* xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[DataContext] tracks changes in entities and saves changed instances to the database when user clicks *OK* in the screen.

* The UI data grid can have columns that display arbitrary visual components.

* xref:flow-ui:data/instance-container.adoc#events[ItemPropertyChangeEvent] and xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc#events[CollectionChangeEvent] can be used to react to changes in entities located in data containers.
