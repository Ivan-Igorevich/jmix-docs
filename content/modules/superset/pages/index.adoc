= Superset

The Superset add-on is designed to integrate Jmix applications with https://superset.apache.org/[Apache Superset^]. It provides the `SupersetDashboard` component and related functions that allow you to embed dashboards created in Apache Superset into application views.

In order to display a dashboard in your application, all you need to do is configure the Superset URL and credentials, and add the `SupersetDashboard` component to a view.
