= JPQL Extensions

This section describes https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/JPQL[Java Persistence Query Language^] extensions that can be used in Jmix applications.

[[session-and-user-attributes]]
== Session and User Attributes

xref:security:authentication.adoc#session-attributes[Session attributes] created using `SessionData` are available in any JPQL query with the `session_` prefix. For example, you can set an attribute using `SessionData`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/data-access-ex1/src/main/java/com/company/demo/bean/CustomerService.java[tags=session-data]
----

Then you can use the `customerCode` attribute value in a query as follows:

[source,text]
----
select e from Customer e where e.code = :session_customerCode
----

Similar to session attributes, you can access attributes of the currently authenticated user through parameters with the `current_user_` prefix. For example, if the xref:security:users.adoc#entity[user entity] has the `email` attribute, you can use it in a query as follows (provided that the `Customer.manager` attribute is a reference to the user entity):

[source,text]
----
select e from Customer e where e.manager.email = :current_user_email
----

You don't have to set the value for the `session_customerCode` or `current_user_email` parameter. They will be assigned automatically before the query execution. This is especially useful in the framework features where you don't have full control over the execution of the query, like xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc#jpql-policy[JPQL policies] of row-level roles or JPQL conditions of the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/genericFilter.adoc[] component.

[[case-insensitive-substring-search]]
== Case-Insensitive Substring Search

You can use the `(?i)` prefix in the value of a query parameter to easily specify conditions for case-insensitive search by any part of the string. For example, consider the query:

[source, jpql]
----
select c from Customer c where c.name like :name
----

If you pass the `(?i)%doe%` string as a value of the `name` parameter, the query will return `John Doe` if such a record exists in the database, even though the case of characters is different. It will happen because the framework will run the SQL query with the `lower(C.NAME) like ?` condition and `%doe%` parameter value.

Note that such search will not use the index on the `name` field, even if such exists in the database.

[[functions]]

[[macros]]
== Macros

JPQL query text can include macros, which are processed before the query is executed. They are converted into the executable JPQL and can additionally modify the set of query parameters.

The macros solve the following problems:

* Provide a workaround for the limitation of JPQL, which makes it impossible to express the condition of dependency of a given field on current time (for example, expressions like "current_date - 1" do not work).

* Enable comparing `Timestamp` type fields (the date/time fields) with a date.

[[macro-between]]
=== @between

Has the format `++@between(field_name, moment1, moment2, time_unit)++` or `++@between(field_name, moment1, moment2, time_unit, user_timezone)++`, where

* `++field_name++` is the name of the compared attribute.

* `moment1`, `moment2` - start and end points of the time interval where the value of `++field_name++` should fall into. Each of the points should be defined by an expression containing the `now` variable with an addition or subtraction of an integer number.

* `++time_unit++` - defines the unit for time interval added to or subtracted from `now` in the time point expressions and time points rounding precision. May be one of the following: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`.

* `++user_timezone++` - an optional argument that if set, defines that the current user's time zone must be considered in the query.

The macro gets converted to the following expression in JPQL: `++field_name >= :moment1 and field_name < :moment2++`.

Example 1. Customer was created today:

[source, jpql]
----
select c from Customer where @between(c.createTs, now, now+1, day)
----

Example 2. Customer was created within the last 10 minutes:

[source, jpql]
----
select c from Customer where @between(c.createTs, now-10, now, minute)
----

Example 3. Documents dated within the last 5 days, considering current user time zone:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @between(d.createTs, now-5, now, day, user_timezone)
----

[[macro-today]]
=== @today

Has the format `++@today(field_name)++` or `++@today(field_name, user_timezone)++` and helps to define a condition checking that the attribute value is within the current day. Essentially, this is a special case of the `@between` macro.

Example. Customer was created today:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @today(d.createTs)
----

[[macro-date-equals]]
=== @dateEquals

Has the format `++@dateEquals(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateEquals(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition checking that `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) is within the day passed as `parameter`.

Example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @dateEquals(d.createTs, :param)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` parameter. To set an offset in days, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateEquals(d.createTs, now-1)
----

[[macro-date-before]]
=== @dateBefore

Has the format `++@dateBefore(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateBefore(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition checking that `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) is earlier than the date passed as `parameter`.

Example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @dateBefore(d.createTs, :param, user_timezone)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` attribute. To set an offset in days, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateBefore(d.createTs, now+1)
----

[[macro-date-after]]
=== @dateAfter

Has the format `++@dateAfter(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateAfter(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition that the date of the `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) is after or equal to the date passed as `parameter`.

Example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @dateAfter(d.createTs, :param)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` attribute. To set an offset in days, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where @dateAfter(d.createTs, now-1)
----

[[macro-enum]]
=== @enum

Allows you to use a fully qualified enum constant name instead of its database identifier. This simplifies searching for enum usages throughout the application code.

Example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from Doc where d.type = @enum(com.company.sample.entity.DocType.INVOICE)
----
