== Web Map Service

Web Map Service (WMS) is an http://www.opengeospatial.org/[OGC] standard for serving up map images over HTTP. Map images are usually generated by a map server using data from GIS database. This format is similar to map tiles, but more general and not so well optimized for using in web applications.

WMS supports a number of different request types, but the main operations are:

* *GetCapabilities* — an operation that returns an XML document describing the service (supported parameters, image formats, available layers, etc.).
* *GetMap*  — an operation that returns a map image for a specified area and content. The add-on uses this operation to obtain images from WMS.

It's important not to confuse the concept of the add-on's layer with the layer in WMS. WMS provides a set of layers defined in the `GetCapabilities` XML document. The WMS Layer of the add-on displays the resulting images provided by WMS. These images are being built using one or more layers in WMS.

The add-on does not work with *GetCapabilities* operation, so you can find out the information about the available layers in WMS in one of the following ways:

* Find it in `GetCapabilities` XML document. You can obtain it by sending a URL request to the server and get the response as an XML document. The URL request looks like this: `BASE_WMS_URL?request=GetCapabilities`.
* Use a GIS software (such as https://qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]). http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/working_with_wms.html[See] a tutorial on how to work with WMS in QGIS.

[[xyz-tiles]]
== XYZ Tiles

XYZ is a de facto OpenStreetMap standard, also known as https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames[Slippy Map Tilenames], defining scheme for tiles that are served through a web server.

These tiles can be accessed via URL following certain pattern: `\http://.../\{z}/\{x}/\{y}.png`, where `z` is the zoom level, and `x`,`y` identify the tile.

For example, https://www.openstreetmap.org/[OpenStreetMap] tiles URL pattern is: `\https://\{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/\{z}/\{x}/\{y}.png`.

Some of them are free, while others require registration and may have free tile requests limit. Be sure to check the providers usage policies before using them.
