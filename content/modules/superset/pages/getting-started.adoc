= Getting Started with Superset

This section provides instructions for getting started with integrating Superset into your application.

You will use the Onboarding application created in the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section as a starting point. You can download the complete source code of this application from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository.

Open the project in Jmix Studio and add the Superset add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

The original data model of the Onboarding application looks as follows:

Add the `salary` attribute of the `Float` type to the `User` entity.

To see some salary numbers in demonstration data, assign a salary value in `DemoDataInitializer.initUsers()` method or just update users manually when you run the application.

The `salary` and `department` attributes will serve as the basis for the following charts in a Superset dashboard:

* A bar chart to compare employees' salaries.
* A table with the average salary by department.
* A card to show the employees' average salary.

These charts will enable more data-driven decisions in HR management and planning.
