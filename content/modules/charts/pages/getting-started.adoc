= Getting Started with Jmix Charts
:page-aliases: charts:quick-start.adoc

This section provides instructions on getting started with integrating charts into your application.

You will use the Onboarding application as a starting point.
If you haven't created this application, you can refer to the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section, which offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for developing the application.

Otherwise, download the complete application source code from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository. Next, follow the instructions in the xref:studio:project.adoc#opening-existing-project[Opening Existing Project] section to open it in Jmix Studio.

Add the Charts add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

Letâ€™s look at the model of the sample onboarding application.

You need to add the following attributes to the `User`:

* Salary (float)
* Teamwork (int)
* Hard Skills (int)
* Soft Skills (int)
* Problem Solving (int)
* Assessment Total (int): The sum of teamwork, hard skills, soft skills and problem-solving scores.

These attributes' data will serve as the basis for the following charts:

* A bar chart to compare employees' salaries and assessment scores.
* A pie chart to show the distribution of onboarding statuses.
* A radar chart to illustrate individual employee skills in various areas.

These charts will enable more data-driven decisions in HR management and planning.
