= Exporters

The `DataGridExporter` interface is designed to export the `DataGrid` content to a particular format and download it. An instance of `DataGridExporter` is passed to the `setDataGridExporter()` method of xref:grid-export:actions.adoc[ExportAction].

`DataGridExporter` has two standard implementations:

* `ExcelExporter` is used in the xref:grid-export:actions.adoc#excel-export-action[ExcelExportAction] action.

* `JsonExporter` is used in the xref:grid-export:actions.adoc#json-export-action[JsonExportAction] action.

You can create a custom exporter by extending a standard one or by implementing the `DataGridExporter` interface from scratch, for example:
