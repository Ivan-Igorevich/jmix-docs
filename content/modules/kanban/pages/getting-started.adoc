= Getting Started with Kanban

This section provides a guide on how to get started with integrating Kanban into your application.

You will use the Onboarding application created in the xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Tutorial] section as a starting point. You can download the complete source code of this application from the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2[jmix-framework/jmix-onboarding-2^] GitHub repository.

Open the project in Jmix Studio and add the Kanban add-on according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

The original data model of the Onboarding application looks as follows:

Add a new entity - `KanbanTask`.

To see some tasks in the demonstration data, create entity instances in the `DemoDataInitializer` class or just create tasks manually when you run the application.

The `KanbanTask` will be used to display on the Kanban board.
